          American Girl Is Learning to Run Aeroplane Seeks License HARRIET QUIMBY, a young woman
          from California who has been doing newspaper work in New York, has decided to learn to
          manage an aeroplane^ and she Is taking lessons in flying at Moisant's school at Mineola.
          N. Y. She expresses herself ,ub highly pleased with her experience as far as she's gone
          and says that she thinks flying Is safer than riding at high speed in an automobile. Like
          most other persons, •he enjoys the sensation of rapid motion, and she says this delight
          can be had In its moat fascinating form while in the air. Miss Qulmby's experiences have
          not been altogether pleasant, as she has had a part in two accidents, neither of which
          resulted seriously to her, though two Moisant monoplanes were smashed. Miss Quimby was
          riding as a passenger when a bad landing was suet and she was thrown from her seat She
          escaped with a few bruises. A day or two later while running the machine along the ground
          she smashed one wheel when the craft careened. In the pictures above Miss Quimby 1s shown
          in her fetching aviation costume and when seated tu the driver's pl&a*
          en a monoplane.

          promptly at 4:30 every morning, oat with the very earliest- birds,; making- the most

          backed satin, fitting the slender, youthful; figure trimly, High,, velvet-topped boots,
          heavy'goggles,' and a hood attached to the jacket completed a very striking ana very
          practical flying outfit. But the part that piqued the curiosity of those who straggled 1
          out •to the flying grounds while the dew was. still on the grass was a. thick veil that
          swung from the top of the hood and covered the s young aviator's face../ -Curiosity begot
          rumors, and more people came out s to watch this early bird. And then one morning, after
          two weeks .of baiting the curious, there was a little t more wind than usual., and, as the
          'aviator crossed the field toward j the hangars,, the veil was blown' aside long' enough

          Miss Quimby Makes Beauti ful Flight, but Misses Requirements. Special to Th Tribune. NEW
          YORK. July 31. Harriet Quim by, the onjy woman In t Ills country flrat trial for her
          pilot's license be to operate o monoplane, made a fore official of the Aero Cluh of
          America here this evening und fell short In inc. accurate landing mat by 40 feet. As a
          result, this discredits a performance of negotiating five figure eights In per fect, form,
          and will make It necessary for MIrb Quimby to trv again. Everybody on the field at Garden
          City mid off tonight to watch the young wom an fly for her license nnd an expression of
          regret at her hard luck, In missing bv so narrow a margin was heard on ail sides. She madn
          a beautiful exhibition, hanking on the curves and handling the Molsant monoplana with an
          case and smoothness which elicited warm praise irnm me omer aviators. When aho came down
          for accurate land ins: within 160 fret of a Riven point, nhe had ov.cr passed the mark by
          40 feet. Siie probahly will tray apaln tomorrow. While ondeavorlnc to fly In a Bleriot
          type monoplano. Miss Quimby met with a mishnp last May that halted hor flying career for
          some time. When she had been .taking lessons In aviation scarcely more than two weeks she
          made a clover flight a few davs before the accident, and whllo attempt ing to repeat the
          performance turned at the eant. end of the field at Hempstead. I... I while apparently
          running over the grass at top speed. The result was that the wheels of her monoplane
          buckled and part of the running gear waa broken. This sent the aeroplane over its side,
          breaking a wing. Miss Quimby romalned In her seat and with rare presence of mind shut off
          the power before the arrival of the employees of tho hangar.

          Girl Made Air Pilot First Airship Queen Miss Harriet Quimby, whose intrepid feats in
          monoplane won her a pilot's license. California Woman 1$ First of Her Win Professional
          License HEMPSTEAD, L.. L, Aug. I.—Miss Harriet Qulmby was awarded a pilot's license today
          by the Aero Club of America, the governing body of aero nautics in this country. This is
          the first license that has ever been awarded to a woman aviator in America. Miss Quimby
          flew in a Moisant monoplane. Miss Quimby anJ the Aero officials, Q. Campbell Wood and
          Baron d'Oroy, and a large number of aviation en thusiasts were on the field shortly be
          fore 5 o'clock this morning, but a dense fog made flying impossible until almost 7
          o'clock. Conditions could not have been more perfect. Thoroughly composed. Miss Quimby
          rose gracefully In the air. com pleting five figure 8s about 150 feet in the air and then
          landed not only within the 164 foot mark designated by the conditions, but also made a
          world's record for landing. Her mark was 7 feet 9 inches. With a brief rest to cool off
          the motor. Miss Quimby again rose in the air.and again completed all the remain ing figure
          Bs, turning first to right and then to left with all the skill of an experienced aviator,
          and landing on her descent at the 124 foot mark. i&ls* Quimby then started for the
          altitude, —liich calls for a height of 164 feet. She reached more than 200 feet and soared
          about in a large circle before coming to the ground, where she was enthusiastically
          greeteJ. Miss Quimby is a former San Fran cisco girl, Miss Matilda Moisant and probably
          Miss Blanche Srott will short ly apply for their pilot's licenses. Ferdinand de Murias of
          Havana, Cuba, today tried for his pilot's license and succeeded. During the first round he
          obtained his altitude while making his first five figure Bs.

        <text>UK GIKI. Hl-RKLY MADE GOOD. Woman Avl?(or U? Make a Public Flight in This Country
          Getaway in a Bm>ie that Made The Flags Whip. Y. Ajnerican. Miss Harriet Quimby, who writes
          ileces about the theatres for one of he illustrated weeklies, took her rusty monoplane in
          hand yesterday ifternoon and made the first flight sver made by a woman in this ountry. It
          was at the Richmond :ounty Agricultural Society's annuil fair. She started from the field
          and twooped out over the meadowland iivd the Narrows. Three times she (hot around this
          circuit and in the ive or six minutes she was in the ilr there was just one minute vhen
          Fred Moissant, Mathilda Moi(ant (brother and sister of John doisant,) Capt. Tom Bal.dwin,
          Lee Hammond and the other thousands >f people who were watching her vere about ready to
          stop breathing, rhat was when she came to grass it the end of the ride. Miss Quimby took
          it on a drive rorn 200 or 300 feet, brought up vithin a few feet of the ground ind then
          stubbed the toe of her Iyer. Bump, bump, she went along he uneven surface of the infield
          i.nd the hop and quick descent were he kind that airmen don't ike to see. Sometimes a
          monoplatis urns a handspring when it acts ike that, but Miss Quimby quieted ts wings and
          it behaved. Through the afternoon while the ^ind was whipping out the flags m the stands
          Miss Quimby sat in he Moisant automobile .with the ilum colored hood of her plum olored
          flying suit shading her yes. She seemed as calm as a 'Oman who sat in front of the j
          arachute jumpers' tent a few feet j way placidly knitting. Miss luimbv looked up
          occasionally to lie whipping flags and her cheeks fere perhaps a little more flushd than
          those of the other women :i the car. Her fingers locked and nlocked a queer bracelet. 'I
          want to make good,' she said o those who came to wish her nek. 'Oh, how 1 want to make
          ood!' A few feet away her instructor, w. J. Houpert, was saying somehing about her flying.
          'She is the best one I ever aught,' he said. 'I don't say it 4 ecause she is a woman.
          Yesterday 4 he went up with a Gnome engine or the first time. 1 was sure she 4 rould break
          some wood before she inished. They almost always do he first time. But she didn't 4 Vait
          till you see her!' 4 Miss Quimby's eyes grew brighter nd the little drops on her ear- ings
          shook as she laughed when 4 omeone told her about this. 'Well, he never gave me that Mich
          satisfaction,' said she. 4 Up came Capt. Tom Baldwin. Looks bad,' said he. 'Lee is go- ng
          to try it.' And try it young Lee Hammond he Boston boy, who has been going i p only three
          months, certainly did. 4 hey rolled out one of the Baldwin red devils for him and he made
          J clean getaway, fluttered just a 4 ttle as he came out of the protecion of the bluff to
          winw&rd, and tien skimmed away over the wa- 4 ir toward Cone^' island. He was ack
          prosen.^y and went up to the iL'.Stint car. He told Miss 4 luimby that it was pretty
          'bloby.' She had been watching him hrough field glasses, and she said 4 he knew he was
          working all the ime. He said he'd try it again. 'his time he went off over the wa- 4 sr,
          but on the home trip his moDr developed crankiness and he fas glad enough to glide to the
          leadows, 1,000 feet or so outside lie field. Even before they got a report on 4 is
          accident, which wasn't serious in ny way, Capt. Balawin decided tiat it was time for Miss
          Quimby 4 a go up. The wind had died pereptibly. She motored to the lowr fielloak and stood
          there in puttees and lie waistless haremette of the airroman.</text>

          If You're Going Up in the
          Air Make One of These
          This attractive flying costume was designed by Miss Harriet
          Quimby, the first woman aviator in America. And she has it on
          herself In the picture. It consists of two garments, a blouse and
          knickerbockers. The material used is a plum-covered satin-faced
          cloth.
          A monk hood is attached to the neat fitting blouse that is rut
          with the long shoulders and closes under the arm.
          The knickerbockers are provided with a row of buttons on either
          of the inside seams, which when unfastened transforms the trouser
          t'ttes into a short divided skirt.
          When not in her machine Miss Quimby covers her costume with
          a long coat. She says in reality there is no need of the short skirt
          arrangement.

          Finally, after waiting eight dreary days at Dover, the day arrived whom she felt she could
          make a safe and sane flight, incidentally breaking a few records and causing a thrill of
          pride in the breasts of American sportsmen. It was a cloudy day, but there was no foe and

          long, and It must be acknowledged our curiosity was not un mingled Willi fright. Of a
          sudden the silence was broken by a swift ru mor, the wings of the door opened noi.-.ily,
          and M. de Talleyrand advanc ed, with a loud and intelligible voice uttering the magic word
          that niude the world tremble. 'The emieror.' Imme diately Napoleon made his appearance and
          hailed for a minute as if to be admired. So many portraits exist of this aston ishing man,
          bis history has been so much written altout. all the stories told by tbe children of his
          old soldiers will live so long, that the generations to come will know him almost us well
          as ourselves. But what will be difficult to grasp is bow deep and unexpected the
          impression was which those felt who saw him for the firstiaie. As for me, I experienced a
          sort of stupor, a mute surprise, like that which seizes one at tbe aspect of a prodigy. It
          seemed to me that he wore un aureole. Tbe only thought I could frame when 1 recovered from
          this first shock was that such a being could not possibly die: that such a mighty organ

          iugenious devices for the physician may be mentioned a watch constructed on the 'stop'
          principle w hereby the number of pulse beats per minute may be indicated. A push but ton
          is pressed at the beginning of the count and again at tbe twentieth pul sation, when the
          cumber of beats per minute is shown on a dial without tbe necessity for calculation. Still
          another push ou the button brings the counter back to the starting point. In the ordi miry
          method of taking the pulse the observer is obliged lo do two things at tbe same time count
          the beats and keep his eye on the second hand of his watch. With the pulse watch only one
          operation is necessary, tbe counting of tbe pulsation up to twenty, when the push button

          human toll that Is exacted by the sport of aviation, but in the long list of such sac
          rifices of life none so affects the popular imagination as that of Har riet Quimby—the
          most daring of airwomen, yet so dainty, pretty and essentially feminine that she came to
          be known as the 'Dresden China Aviatrice.” In keeping with her outward as pect of
          frivolous femininity, too, were her odd and peculiarly fem inine superstitions. Always
          when In the air, though she handled her powerful craft with all the cool skill and courage
          of any of her masculine rivals, she was obsessed by the notion of a mischievously

          experiment.. Miss Quimby's 100-horsepower Bierlot machine suddenly stood on Its head, up a
          mile in the sky above the city of Boston, pitching the daring woman nnd her male passenger
          in to the shallow waters of Dorchester Ray. Her odd superstition was realized; “Miss
          Dresden China,” as she had half-expected to happen, was broken at last. Harriet Quimby

          rugged and experienced of man-flyers at tacked with trepidation—her friends sought to
          dissuade her on the grounds of her frail .bysique and her generally feminine disadvan
          tages. 'Why,” said one, “your appro priate environment is the blue nnd gold walls of a
          satin-upholstered boudoir In the Louis XV. style. You’re not a medieval German Ama zon by
          Piloty; you’re a Watteau Shepherdness. Why, everybody Is calling you the ‘Dresden China A
          viatrice.'' 'Oh, I don't like that,” laughed Miss Quimby. “Dresden China is so easily
          broken! But I'm going, just thesame.' During that perilous channel pas sage she could
          almost feel the pres ence of that giant-cloud hand flip ping Its fingers playfully about
          her rudder —like a cat playing with a mouse. Long before that, soon af ter she had secured
          her pilot's license and was venturing Into the skies alone she said to one of her In
          timate friends: 'Frequently when I have been flying it has seemed to be as If a huge
          cloud-hand were mischievously rocking my slender little monoplane. It seemed, with a
          playful huger, to be lifting the tail of my machine higher than it should be. I actually
          had to fight with my levers to keep the machine from stand ing on its nose—particu larly
          when coming down through the lower clouds. That giant hand grows more and real the longer
          I fly. Whenever I get among the clouds I can feel it playing with the tall of my machine.”
          Curiously, nothing so well as her own belief in this supernatural agency explains the
          mystery of that fatal plunge Into Dorchester Bay. Her in structors, M. Andre Hau pert.
          Vhose training en abled her to gain her pi lot’s license, has made this significant
          statement: 'It was no lack on the part of Miss Quimby that caused the drop of wom an, man
          and machine to the earth. There was nothing the matter with her machine. It was in perfect
          working trim But. so far as we can tell, something happened wh'ch destroyed its equipoise,
          and instantly she was at the mercy of the air.” 'Something happened.” As Miss Quimby has
          said, that 'something” almost bannened whenever she was among the clouds. It was hard to
          keep that maliciously playful giant finger from flipping the tail of her machine too high
          for her safety—and now, at last it gave a flip with force enough to make resistance
          useless! It is not difficult for an imagine five person to conceive how a n ob session
          like this could, final Ir. so operate on the mind and nerves of 1, ns to produce reactions
          of the muscles used In guiding the machine that would cause a catas trophe identical with
          the one so dreaded by Miss Quimby. Believing that the gigantic cloud-finger was tired of
          playing with her machine, and had given its tail a final, fatal flip, her hands on the
          guiding levers unconsciously reversed their usual procedure. Miss Quimby was a story
          writer, a poet, a dramatist—in fact, a dreamer with a mind extraordinarily active on its
          imaginative side. Her belief in that cloud-hand was no stranger than the beliefs f the an
          cient Greeks in the Immortal beings which controlled all the manifesta tions of nature.
          When Icarus flew high above the Mediterranean with wings made of wax he knew that it was
          in the pow er of Phoebus-Apollo, rolling the sun across the heavens in bls chariot, to
          bring disaster upon him by melting his wax wings, which is exactly what the sun did, and
          the ancient Greek mythological aeroplanist took his fatal plunge into the sea. To
          personify mysterious forces far above the earth, picturing in her mind cloud forces
          concentrated in an intelligent, all-powerful hand, wa« a not unnatural obsession in one of
          Miss Quimby's temperament and r F F •_ iv- F FFF I w B F F? fj '0' fr m IHp' v <^^|^Mum« i?

There was another superstition of Miss Quimby's that had a certain bearing on the catastrophe of her career. She wore a number of Ori ental decorations that, with her com plexion, made her resemblance to fabled queens of Egypt more than merely fanciful. She had, in partic ular, a string of weirdly colored stones that she obtained from a Cairo muleteer. Unless these were around her neck she would not fly. Her own narrative of how she got them is il lustrative of the woman behind .he girl. “I had noticed a most peculiar combination of stones which were around the mule’s temples as part of his head-stall. A number of queer little Oriental gods and goddesses were suspended irregularly from this string of stones. A close examination of them showed that they were all ■really the same god or goddess. I do not know which, and that Ganesha was the name. X think he is a Hindu god of Luck. “I offered the boy a guinea for the string of stones, but ho wanted three times that much. We finally compromised for two guineas. And my luck changed that very day. I have never been so happy as since I bought those little charms' But Ganesha was to play a part in Miss Quimby’s life that, all unfor- seon was tragic almost beyond words. In the office of a London newspaper which had financed her flight across the Channel,' she met with a large replica of Ganesha. The strange idol, with its elephant head, three legs, and three arms, ail on a human body, hud been sent to the news paper office to be destroyed. The newspaper had collected from its readers a number of unlucky talis mans, and Ganesha was among them. Miss Quimby, seeing that he matched the smaller idols which had hung on her Cairo mule’s headstall, begged so hard for Ganesha that the figure was reluctantly turned over to her. And here is Miss Quimby’s version of what happened. •Aiiy one would suppose that after I had rescued Ganesha from such an untimely end as burning he would be grateful and would behave like his little children did. But almost immediately I began to have bad luck.” When Miss Quimby returned to New York after her triumphal crossing of the Channel, Ganesha kept on misbehaving .and she decided finally that she would guillotine him So she had his head cut oif and put the head in a desk drawer, while she used the body of the idol for a paper weight. The day that Miss Quimby was killed in Boston a friend of hers was near her desk and saw Ganesha, with his cut-off head resting again on his shoulder! and still grinning horribly. Miss Quimby bad replaced the head th® day she went to Boston. It was Miss Quimby's oft repeated statement that 'happy people ad bfl long to the same generation,” and she did everything she could to make people happy. She was al cheerful as could be, and in a letter which she posted on her way to too aerodrome the day she met het death she laughingly quotes Omar to show how little she fears that any thing will happen to her and yet how she refuses to take herself ser iously. The quotation, which evi dently answered some entreaty to M careful, toid how improbable it wai 'That Youth’s sweet-scented manu script should close.” Miss Quimby's ambition was to earn enough money before she was thirty-five so that she might retits from dally work to write one ii? book or one big play. The resi dents of Hardelot. the faslilonan.® French resort on the English 1 n nel, had presented her with a bun galow and a large piece of ground for her cross-channel flight, 'b® wanted to go there In the Summ when site retired from business at fairs, and to live her Winters io southern California, where sM owned an orange ranch. But the cloud-hand was too strong for her. It lifted the tail of iiaf monoplane once too often.</text>

        <text>ALL CHICAGO THEATRES CLOSED. Proprietors of Iroquois Theatre Under Arrest ?Also a
          Building Inspector. Chicago (Special).?Every theater in thc City of Chicago is dark and
          with doors locked. Not one of them will bc 'ipen to the public until their managers have
          complied in the fullest manner with ?very section of the ordinances regulating playhouses.
          The total number of dead in the Iro? quois Theater disaster has been definitely
          Established at !)87, of which but 12 remain imidentfiicd. Thc order compelling the
          theaters to close was issued by Mayor Harrison after a conference with Corporation Counsel
          Tohnan, who assured the Mayor that ample legal ground existed for his action. Will J.
          Davis and Harry Powers, pro? prietors of thc Iroquois Theater, and Building Commissioner
          Williams are un? der arrest, charged with manslaughter. They have been released on $10,000
          bonds, and their hearing is set for Janu? ary 12. The warrants for their arrest were sworn
          out by Arthur IC. Hull, who lost his wife and three children in thc fire. Mr. Hull
          explained that his action was not inspired by any motive of ven? geance, but simply to
          make it certain that thc owners of the theater should not es? cape any chance of
          punishment that was rightfully theirs while stage hands and electricians and other
          employes were compelled to suffer. It is a noteworthy fact that Building Commissioner
          Williams, who is now charged with manslaughter in connec? tion with thc greatest fire
          horror Up? country has ever experienced, owes his appointment to a tragedy of similar na?
          ture, but of much less extent, which oc? curred two years ago. Mr. Williams' predecessor
          vacated his office after the burning of thc St. Luke's Sanitarium, at Twentieth street and
          Wa? bash avenue. This was thc institution in which a score of men suffering from de?
          lirium tremens were burned to death while strapped to their beds. Mr. Wil? liams was
          selected with thc idea that he was thc proper man to sec that no such catastrophe could
          happen again. CAUSED BY HEAT FRON FLOODLIGHT. Important Testimony at the Investigation By
          (he Coroner. Chicago (Special). Fire Inspector Monroe Eulkcrson renewed his investi?
          gation into the causes of thc disaster. Two stage hands were questioned for two hours.
          Then W. A. Merriam, man? ager for thc George A. Fuller Construc? tion Company, builders of
          thc theater, was called into thc office. Thc company's attorney was with him. William
          McMullen. manager of thc spot light, which is alleged to have caused the fire in thc
          Iroquois Theater, testified before the investigation hearing that the spot light had
          nothing to do with it. Ile said the fire was caused by the heat from the floodlight used
          to 'flood' the theater. McMulkcn said his floodlight was turned out when the fire started.
          He said he was looking at the floodlight and saw the flimsy border blow directly over the
          floodlight. The heat from this light, he alleges, caused the fire. The city electrician
          followed with tes? timony that thc heat from thc floodlight was sufficient to cause thc
          fire. McMullen is considered by thc police to be one of the most important wit? nesses. He
          was in charge of thc spot light which set fire to thc scenery and re? sulted in the large
          loss of life. James J. Hamilton, a scenery shifter, explained what seemed to many at thc
          fire to bc an explosion. 'Five minutes after the fire started,' said bc, 'the big set
          piece in the shape of a fan used as a finale in the second act fell 40 feet to the stage.
          Thc piece was studded with 150 incandescent lamps and weighed several hundred pounds The
          noise of its fall and thc breaking lamps gave forth thc sound of an explo? sion.' Hamilton
          said he was in thc stage? hands' room below thc stage wher someone came downstairs,
          saying: 'Come upstairs quietly. There's z fire up there.' 'When I reached the stage,' snit
          Hamilton, 'thc fire curtain was com? ing down very slowly. I stepped un? der it and joined
          others in urging thc audience to keep quiet. The curtail should have dropped quickly, and
          1 was surprised to see it stick. 'I stayer on the stage until my clothing wa; scorched.
          When I first came up, tin orchestra was playing, and the don blc octet was singing, with
          spark: falling all around them. Not a must cian nor player moved until it was matter of
          life and death.' Hamilton denied that it was the cns tom to have thc cables controlling
          tin ventilators above the stage blocked s' as to make it impossible to open tin
          ventilators. 'The ventilators were opened, I bc lieve, at every performance,' he said
          'Many times the draft from them wa: so strong that it was uncomfortably cool on thc
          stage.' Coroner Traeger has learned tba each of thc 180 drop scenes in the thc ater was
          hung with new, oily, mani!: rope. It is estimated that there wen 75.000 lineal feet of

          fire were beyond description by the', spectators. Old policemen said they had never
          witnessed anything to equal the horror of the disaster. Bodies were found sitting straight
          up In the seats where persons had fainted from tright and then suffocated by smoke and
          gases. In another part of the bal cony where the blaze had been blown 1 upward and back
          one little girl ras found dead. Her hair had been burr.ed j off and her face badly
          scorched by the fiames. In her lap lay a fur muff unharmed by the flames which had swep'.
          over and. around the upper part i of Ik: bedy. Some had fnlicn back In their seats in

          children clambered on to the platform of the fire escape, each crushing the other In the
          mad flight to climb to a place of safety. The terrible crush prevented any from de
          scending. While the heartrending ap peals for help rose high above the din Inside the
          theater, and while the aw ful fight for mastery was going on on tbe small Iron platform,
          two huge iron doors,' which up to that time had held the flames inside, burst open and a
          wave of fire swept upon the mass of numanlty. With shrieks, mingled with curses and
          pleadings, the twenty or more were swept from- the platform. One T,cz:an'ncarest the
          outside fell head ier to the pavement, ajihting upon .v '7Mrii;A !er head. In a momenF

          and corner from orchestra pit to gal- lery before 2 p. m. At C0 p. m.' the kindling spark
          had set the awful fire and at 4 the ashes of the dead were scattered tliroujrh the awful
          ruin. At the hour when the matinee crowd should have poured merrily fron, the house scores
          who had escaped burning in the fiery prison lay writhing where they fell on the streets or
          had been earried, bruised, broken and dying, to the Northwestern University bui'ding and
          stores in the vicinity of Randolph and Dearborn streets. The anguish of those who
          perished, caught in the burst of flame that shot from the stage to the balcony, In the
          midst of the performance of 'Mr. Blue Beard,' was lost to the 10,000 people who witnessed
          the horrors in the streets. While the panic of those who fought at the main entrance of
          the theater was of itself a terrible thin, the wom en and children who leaned from win
          dows anl fire escapes, with their bodies enveloped in flame, the men who ran madly through
          the streets shrieking in their agony, and the spectacle of thrilling rescues by firemen
          and vol unteers caused another panic among the crowds In the streets which threat ened to
          add to the horror of the trag edy. Above the crackling of the flames could be heard the
          agonized shrieks of dying men, the despairing signal of some unfortunate for succor. Then,
          tearing, struggling at the blackened mass to penetrate it and effect a res cue, they
          labored, cursing and crying. Some of the still living victims were rescued and taken out
          in time to be saved. Others died before they could be lifted from the heap of dead; oth
          ers, while they were being carried down the staircases. IISCAPE OF ACTOU EDDIE FOT Tells
          How the Fire Started and the As esto Curtain Failed. 'Eddie' Foy said after his escape:
          'The fire began in the middle of the second act. It was when the moon light scene was cn.
          An electric wire broke and was grounded, and from this tbe fiames were started in the rear
          of the stage. The stage is un usually wideband there was so great a draft the flames
          spread rapidly. They soon had attacked all the scenery In the rear .of the stage. I never
          saw flames spread so rapidly. When the fire first began T went to the footlights, and to
          prevent alarming the audience I said there was a slight blaze and that it would be better
          to go out quiet ly. 'Then I stepped back and ordered the asbestos curtain down. This, when
          half way down, refused to go farther and thus an additional draft was cre ated. This swept
          the flames out into the auditorium and I knew the theater was doomed. I hurried back on
          the stage and aided in getting the women members of the company Into the al ley. Some of
          them were in the dress hag room and were almost overcome before they could get to the
          stage and to the. doors. When I saw all were out I hurried to the hotel. There was no
          chance to change my costume.' Chicago Tribune Editor Dead. Indianapolis, Jan. 4. John W.

          Vic tims Goes on Stcdily Funereal Days. Chicago, Jan. 2. Fitiless Investiga tion of the
          Iroquois fire horror divides attention with the burial of the dead. Archibald Lernard,
          chief electrician of the Iroquois theater, was taken into custody by the police. After
          being closely questioned for two hours Ber nard was formally charged with 'man slaughter.'
          Next Chief of Police O'Neill sent detectives to summon Manager Will J. Davis, of the
          Iroquois theater, to police headquarters. Darin and Power Appear. Davis promptly appeared
          at the of fice of the chief, accompanied by his business partner, Harry Powers. The two
          managers talked for some time with Chief O'Neill, who. finally dis missed them, saying
          that he himself would be responsible for their appear ance whenever they may be wanted. 4T
          want to question him,' Chief O'Neill said, when asked the reason for the summons. 'I am
          cot arresting him. If I thought that Managers Will J. Davis or Harry L. Powers would leave
          Chicago I would lock them up immediately. But they will remain. Both are citizens of

          and to get his guarantee that the members of the 'Moonlight double octette' will not leave
          Chicago before the inquest. Otherwise it may be necessary to take the entire com pany into
          custody.' Although mem bers of the 'Blue Beard' company who had been questioned by the
          police were allowed to return to hotels detectives were sent also. The detectives were
          ordered to make headquarters at the hotels and watch the members of the company to see
          that none left Thirty Teachers Dead or Missing. Superintendent cf Schools Cooley an

          schools, and six teachers are slUl reported missing, making a total of thirty. CONFUSION
          IN DEATH LISTS fctve Persons Have Been Put Into Them by HI eary Recorders. The removal of
          bodies from the pub lic morgues to private undertaking es tablishments developed a fresh
          ele ment of uncertainty In computing to tals of dead and missing. The count of actual
          corpses most generally agreed upon .was 582, including 450 identified and, 132
          unidentified. The City Press association had the names of 509 identified dead. A
          re-exauiina- tion of the list showed that num bers were included incoriectly. In stead of
          being of the dead the names f some were of those wjo had identi fied bodies. Coroner
          Traeger issued an arrcal to the public to notify him of all fire deaths that may have
          escaped the rec ords. 'It has come to mv notice enUl Coroner Traeger, 'that bodies of some
          persons were removed from the tem porary hospitals and relief stations directly after tne
          fire. In the hurry and confusion! persons who could Identify reina.ns were allowed to take
          them to their homes without question. I understand that this occurred in a few instances.
          I have also learned that some of the injured were taken to Drivate resi dences and
          hospitals without the mak ing of any record, and it is reported to me that some have since
          died. I ask that any citizen knowing of anv such occurrence report the matter to my of
          fice at once.' The crowds of searchers for rela tives and friends continued at the
          morgues. While the number of per sons pressing for tidings or Identifica tion showed
          material diminution the anxiety and weariness wa3 intensified. The constant presence of
          the black wagons of undertakers were conspicu ous additions to the many scattered
          neighborhoods where the morgues are located. A mournful variation was the occasional
          appearance of bands play ing dirge, as funerals slowly passed towards churches, railway
          stations and cemeteries. 6EAKCUERS WHO CANNOT FIND lost Ones Who Will, Perhaps, Never Be
          Seen by Tbelr Friends. Many men appeared at the door of Rolston's and Jordan's morgues who
          had been on their feet for forty-eight hours constantly searching for those they had lost.
          The greater number of dead are in these two places, and men who had viewed the ghastly
          rows of corpses before and had gone on un availing searches to every other morgue, and
          undertaking room in the city to which the dead from the 'the ater had been taken came back
          once more to Rolston's and Jordan's almost in despair, but hoping against hope that they
          might have verlooked their dead im the gTeat number that had crowded the tables and
          floors. In some cases they were successful, In many others they were not Prac tically all
          of the lodies which admit of careful Identification have been car ried away, and of those
          which remain the majority are in such a condition that only the most minute and careful
          inspection will be able to reveal their Identity to those who knew them best, One of the
          saddest and happiest cases was that of Herbert and Agnes Lange, of 1C32 Barry avenue. Poth
          children had attended the per formance, and after many tours cf tireless s2archinj
          thebrojien-hrarted father finely found the Caugl ter In an undertaking establishment.
          Lange, filmest exhausted through his con tinuous trips from morgue to morgue and from
          hospital to hospital, from police stations to the coroner's office and then back through
          the wearisome round again and again, came in utter despair to the olnce of Chief of Police
          O'Neill and begged two detectives to assist him. He also plended with news paper men.
          Lange eaiu these were nis only children end the detectives and aewspaper men promised him
          every assistance. Finally the body of a girl was found and the broken-heart ed father
          smiled through his tears as he gathered up the little form and car ried it to his
          carriage. 'I have one of them at last,' he said, 'and this will be a great comfort to her
          mother.' The absolute fall irre of Lange to identify any one of the bodies as that of his
          son aroused some hope that the loy might still be alive and cared for In some hospital:
          But Lang's sorrow was turned to joy when he reached home. As he drove up to the door with
          the Ixxly which he had brought from the morgue as that of his daughter he was greeted by
          hU wife, who told him that their two children had returned home in the evening in safety.
          They had become dazed apparently and had been wan dering around the city without know ing
          where they were. Lang at once re turned to the morgue with the body of the little girl
          which he thought to be that of his own child. CAt'SE OF THE CATASTROPHE Man VTho Saw What
          Did It Tells the Po lice Hun It Occurred. The police vigorously pushed their inquiry Into
          the causes of the fire and made several other arresis oi .tage hands, among them William
          McMul len, the operator of the light which, started the fire, and Wilson Kerr, a fly man
          at the theater. McMullen's story was as follows: 'I was standing on the iron bridge at the
          right side of the stage from which the 'spotlight' Is operated. The lamp seemed In good
          condition, but in the middle of .the second act, just as I changed from a.wite light to a
          blue one, the arc between the carlwns splut tered and jumped. A spark struck the frayed
          edge on the Inside of the border of the curtain drapery. A flame which I should say was
          about twelve inches long shot up. I abandoned the lamp and clapped my han l upon the
          flames, but they spread 1n spite of me. 'I cnll Vi to have the fire curtain lowered, nnd
          yelled to the house fire man to help me. He came with a pat ent tire extinguisher which
          had no ef fect on the fiames. Finally I jumped from' the bridge to the stage. A little
          child in one cf the front boxes had al ready been badly burned. I seized her and carried
          her out and then returned to the theater. Here I worked pulling people out of the choked
          exits until it was useless to stay any longer. ADDITIONAL IDENTIFIED DEAD List of the

          city. The action of the mayor was based on one single violation of the ordinance which is
          intended to protect the pa trons of theaters from just such an oc curence as that which
          cost so many Ufes on Wednesday. This was that every one of those places had omitted to
          supply abestes curtain. The theaters ordered closed. (Ccstlnued ca Fc3 3, Colonn 1)</text>

        <text>PRICE TWO iQEJSTtS. DaBIOIBIBIIBBBOIBIBQ CHICAGO Dec. 31Th e Iroquois theater horror
          grows apace It is the most terrible theater holocaust in history. Out of the 130 0
          persons, mostly women and children, who made up that fatally festal audience yesterday
          afternoon, barely 30 0 escaped unhurt. The latestfiguresare: Dead 564 missing 314 injured
          157, of whom a third will die. The theater was the finest in Chicago, only recently
          finished and/cost half a million dollars. It was supposed to be absolutelyfireproof. At
          this moment it stands nearly intact, with an actual property loss liberally estimated at
          only $20,000, Yet, for a brief but terrible ten minutes its interior was a fiery pit of
          destruction in which hundreds perished miserably. The greatest loss of life, however, was
          due to the panic and the wild rush for the exits, and the stairways leading to them. Many
          of the fire escapes had not yet been put on. DAY O F NERVE BACKING HORROR FOR STRICKEN

          Scenes at the Horror-Haunted Morgue Are Such as to Appal the Hardest HeartThe Search
          Relatives Still Goes On. -'ws^V-s*--. Chicago, Dec, 31.To-day brought only the legacy of
          yesterday's monu- mental calamity and the prediction that the list of fatalities in the
          Iroquois theater fire will run over 600 when information is complete. The latest statement
          of dead at the various morgues is 564 and it is ptated at the various hospitals and hotels
          to which the injured were removed that, of the 157 persons who were injured, probably
          one-third cannot live. The missing to-day were estimated at 314, but it was expected that
          many of these would be accounted for, probably a large majority of them. I t is no
          extravagance of language to say. that the city Is stunned toy the overwhelming tragedy
          which was enacted when the theater which housed 'Mr. Bluebeard' became a chamber of
          horrors indeed. There is the deepest woe in hundreds of homes to-day, deep sorrow in a
          thousand others and a pity beyond the potency of words to convey In all. THE
          SORROW-HAUNTED MORGUE. The first streak of daylight which shone on the snow-covered
          streets found, the morgues still the sorrow-haunted center of many a searcher. There were
          husbands, frenzied parents, wives searching for husbands, husbands searching for wives and
          parents seeking their children, so many of whom lost their lives. In some instances
          wide-eyed children, still dazed from the hor- ror of their experience, groped distressedly
          about in search of father or jnother. The giant stone head of an Iroquois Indian over the
          grand entrance, fit- ting symbol of the cruelty of the deserted structure, stood forth
          from a front unstained by smoke or water. Tho serene without, the interior of the theat/r
          marked it as a true whited sepulchre. STRIKING LIVERY DRIVERS GO TO WORK. Possibly nothing
          could better typify the depth of the sympathy felt for those who suffered directly by the
          calamity than the action of the striking liv- ery drivers. B y a vote, -which -was
          -without a dissenting- voice, it was decided to establish a truce of ten days. President
          Albert Young, following the meeting, issued the following decree, which was distributed
          broadcast: P r- Owing to the great disaster to the public caused by the fire at the
          Iroquois theater, I do hereby declare a truce in the present strike of un- j dertakers and
          livery drivers for ten days, and do further request that j j every man now on strike
          report at once to their respective places of em- j ployment, and do everything in his
          power to assist his employer in caring t for the wants of the public. Wages are to have no
          consideration.

          In their turn the employers issued a call to their striking employes to re- turn to work,
          'irrespective of any previous affiliations with any and all or- ganizations,' and
          promising to protect them in all contingencies which may arise in the future.

          THE SEARCH FOR RELATIVES. All night long the crowds came and went around the morgues where
          the bodies of the victims of the disaster lay. There were the heads of families, brothers,
          sisters and men and women looking for those from outside cities who had been their guests.
          For hours they passed up and down before the long rows of the dead, searching- for the
          faces of their missing. SORROW IN GUNSAULUS HOME. Sorrow reigned in the residence of Dr.
          Frank W. Gunsaulus, the noted divine, who lives at 2618 Prairie avenue. William
          McLaughlin, 19 years of ag e, a nephew of Mrs. Gunsaulus, was one of those severely
          burned. H e was taken to the Presbyterian hospital, where the attending physicians
          entertained no hope for his recovery. Mr. McLaughlin's home is in Buenos Aires. He is a
          member of the sophomore class of the Ohio Wesleyan university at Dela- ware, Ohio, and was
          spending his holiday vacation at the Gunsaulus home. He was to have witnessed the marriage
          of Miss Martha Gunsaulus to Henry Ham- ilton Shueler, which takes place at the Frairie
          residence this evening. Owing to his condition all invitations ,to the ceremony have been
          recalled and only the immediate relatives of the bride and groom will be present. THE
          MISSING GARTZ CHILDREN. _A.11 night search -was kept up for Mary Dorothy Gartz, 1 1 years
          old, and Barbara Gartz, 4 years old, who attended thft theater with their aunt, Mrs.
          Adelaide Hoptfelt. To-day their bodies had not been found and there seems to be no doubt
          that the children have perished. They are the daughters of A. F. Gartz and the nieces of
          R. T. Crane, the millionaire manufacturer of this City. Mra, Hoptfelt 'was taKen from the
          theater severely tourneO. about the head, and shoulders. The children are believed to have
          be Q caught in the crush, coming down from the balcony, and to have been trampled to death
          on the staircase leading to the main floor. Walter Zeisler, 17 years old, son .of' Mr. and
          Mrs. Sigmund Zeisler, is among the missing. H e is a nephew of Fanny Bloomfleld Zeisler,
          the famous pianiste. OTHER MILLIONAIRES BEREAVED. A party consisting of Mrs. Lucy Garn,

          'SOCIETY. 14 PAGES-FIVE O'CLOCK. of 1300 Barely 300 Escaped Uninjured. The struggle at
          these choked channels of egress must have been frightful, as the stronger tramping over
          the living floor of the weaker frenziedly made their way out. Itrwas a battle for lifewith
          everyone for himself. To this dread but elemental law there must have been many heroic
          exceptions. The story of these heroes wjio helped others and sacri^ced their own lives,
          will neverbe known. The responsibility of thefireis ascribed to careless electric light
          operators who placed their apparatus too near the scenery. Then there was the fireproof
          curtain of asbestos that failed to work at the critical moment. It is even charged that it
          never had worked well The work of rescue was quickly and well organized. Hundreds of
          doctors, nilrses and helpers were almost instantly on the scene, whilefiremen,policemen
          and volunteers did yeoman work. It will take some time to identify all thedead and account
          for all the missing. Some of the latter will never be accounted for except in |hg list of,

          destruction of the Iro quois theater in Chicago, was whole sale salesman for the Thief
          River Falls Lumber company and was a well known and very popular citizen. The day before
          Christmas he left his home to'visit his mother and a sister in Milwaukee and later con

          who was one of the victims of the great fire in Chi cago, was principal of the Central

          was popular and very competent. She was about 35 and her former home was Rushford, Minn.
          She was born in Fillmore county, Min nesota. At the close of the schools for the holidays
          she went to Chicago to visit her sister, Mrs. James Maloney, at 605 Washington avenue.
          They attended the matinee yesterday and were both killed. A brother wired here that he had
          found the body of his married sister, but had been unable to locate that of Miss Peterson.
          He was notified at which morgue the remains were and later sent word that he had found
          both bodies. It is presumed that Miss Peterson's body was not burned, as identification
          was evidently made from her card cace, and Fargo was notified last night by the
          undertaker. LEFT WIFE AND SON _ Albert Young, j WWIMMMWMWHWmwMlw||||||, '1 ^_ ENTRANCE TO

          She Swung Out Over the Audience on a Wire So Placed as to Prevent Cur tain's Descent.
          Theatrical Men Think There Was Carelessness -3- in Placing Arc Light Too Near the Scenery,
          Chicago, Dec. 31.The cause of the 'jamming' of the asbestos cur- tain, considered the
          cause of the disaster, was explained to-day by an inspector for the underwriters who made
          a tour of the house and found that the wire on which the queen of the aeriel ballet flew
          out over the audience in the second act held the ashestos,curtain in place and prevented
          it from being lowered. It was shown by the inspector that the wire on which the most spec-
          tacular feature of the show was made practically caused the holocaust. Chicago, Dec.
          31*Among many theatrical men employed in the other Chicago theaters the responsibility for
          the fire was ascribed to-day to the careless placing of electric arc light apparatus too
          close to one of the hanging borders of the scenery. The electrician of a leading Chicago
          theater expressed great surprise on hearing that this was considered a possible cause of
          the fire. 'There never would have been any fire,' he said, 'if proper care had been
          exercised in handling the lights. The electric plant of the theater was in- stalled, as I
          happen to know from personal observation, in accordance with every modern requirement for
          safety. The plant was not to blame. If what I have learned is true, the whole blame rests
          on the person who placed, or was operating a light so close to the curtain.' ASBESTOS
          CURTAIN NEVER /WORKED WELL. The failure of the expected fire protection is attributed by
          insurance men to trouble with the asbestos curtain. The stage is always recognized as the
          danger point in a theater and the desire is to have it cut off from the audi- torium as
          thoroly as possible. The insurance men declare that the curtain at tne Iroquois never
          had,, worfced. perfectly and. that the mechanism, had, not been repaired. M**M*tt*t**m
          LOSS IS ONLY $20,000. _ i E. R. Wetmore, of the insurance firm which placed the insurance
          on the Iroquojs theater, declared to-day that the loss would not exceed $20,000. He also
          asserted that the spread of the flames to the auditorium was due to the failure of the
          asbestos curtain to work properly. A TRADE JOURNAL'S WARNING. On the other hand, a
          prominent trade Journal of Chicago criticized th construction of the Iroquois theater
          early last summer, because it lacked a shaft or flue at the back of the stage for carrying
          the flame's and smoke up- ward and away from the auditorium in the event of lire. Such
          shafts were built in Madison Square jGarden and the Metropolitan opera-house in New York
          and a similar provision is made at the Chicago Auditorium. FIREPROOFING WAS DEFECTIVE The
          method of flreproofing the balcony and gallery,was also declared by this magazine to he.
          defective because metal. lath, was used in what is known as exposed construction, where
          heat would easily affect it. In modern fire- proof buildings this lath is buried in
          concrete. It was the' buckling out of this metal lath and iron rods, giving the impression
          that the galleries themselves were falling, that is believed by some of the contractors to
          have been partly responsible fox- the panic. There was no criticism of the strength of:
          the gal- lery and balcony arches, which were built in the usual manner. 314 WHAT CHIEF
          MUSHAM SAYS TO-DAY. Chief Musham, of the fire department, when -asked to-day what would
          best prevent a repetition of the horror, said: 'I don't know as I can answer that question
          until an investigation has been made as to the cause of this fire. On the whole, I suppose
          it would be a good thing for the department to have active uniformed men prepared to act
          stationed in every theater thru every performance. I understand that New York has them and
          that they are paid by the management of the theaters. 266 'They had a man in the Iroquois
          who was an ex-member of the Chicago fire department He was old, but he should have known
          what to do. It seems to me that there is nothing in the world, at least nothing that I can
          think of at the present moment, that can save lives -when a thousand, persons try to pass
          thru one doorway at one time. It was the rushing, the crowding</text>

          600 Corpses Recovered From the Iroquois Opera House Ruins-More Believed to be in the
          Debris- Fire Escapes Were not in Position-Asbestos Fire Curtain Would Not Work CHICAGO,
          Dec. 31. —Still confront ed by chaos that will take days to etraighten, police and
          coroner's offi cials at noon today, after 20 hours' con tinuous toil, admitted their
          inability to compile a correct list of the dead, injured and missing in the Iroquois
          theater horror. A revised statement has been issued placing the number of dead at 531. The
          number missing is now 200. Some are undoubtedly among the unidentified dead. Of the 300
          injured the physicians report that probably 100 will die. Newspaper reports compiled at
          the vari- ous morgues and hospitals up to noon vary. The lowest list of dead is 564 and
          the highest 576. Coroner Traeger has impaneled; a jury and this morning the jurors were
          conduct ed through the numerous morgues, where each body was viewed separately. Sev eral
          times men were compelled to cease their labor when overcome by emotion at the spectacles.
          The bodies of burned children affected them most. Two jurors were unable to go farther
          than the first morgue. They were ex cused and other men were substituted. The jury's
          unpleasant task will probably take until midnight, by which time the last victims will
          probably have been seen. As soon as this is done the hearing of' evidence will be begun.
          Investigation will be complete. Witnesses will be required to say why the doors in the
          children's galleries were not left open so that every means of exit could be used; also
          why the asbestos cur tain failed to work, why the fire escapes were not completed, and
          whether or not several building laws were complied with. I All information now shows that
          had the asbestos curtain worked the loss of life would have been very small. A profound
          air of gloom has settled over the city. The death list is so great that hundreds of
          thousands number either rela- tives, friends or acquaintances among the Victims. Business
          is practically suspend ed. The board of trade closed at noon out of respect for the dead,
          after the morning's apathetic trading. From morgue to morgue weeping ones hurry in quest
          of missing, or emerge from the charnel houses bearing evidences that their search has
          ended and the worst fears realized. The mayor's office is buried in tele grams of inquiry.
          From many cities of America and Europe messages of condo- lence have been received. Equal
          almost to the heart-rending scenes at the morgues is that at the police cus todian's
          rooms, where anxious ones are going over heaps of garments and trinkets left behind in the
          mad rush to escape from the burning theater. Little children's clothing, soiled and torn;
          sealskins of rich value; slippers and skirts torn from struggling women, and portions of
          waisti complete the tragic evidence of that last terrible rush. Five bushel baskets tilled
          with purses, gloves, handkerchiefs and jew elry have been collected. Two barrels were
          required to hold the overshoes and shoes alone. All night long and yet ioday crowds filled
          the streets around the scene of the catastrophe, giving way, to traffic and The Tacoma
          Times. pedestrians only through the active enortg of the police. The Iroquois stands to
          out ward gaze intact, with all the glamor of new construction. Its marble columns and
          sculptured figures of tragedy and com edy are not even blackened with the death-dealing
          unoko. The grand entrance, with its marble staircases and terraces, it still beautiful and
          intact, but inside not a vestige of anything inflammable is left. HORRIBLE DISCOVERY.

          police today noticed sirandg ot a woman s hair protruding, iuey picked the ice away and
          lound part ol a woman s skull, loreurm, two tingers ami a portion of the thigh, it is
          believed that sue must have jumped from a great height and the remainder of her body was
          either picked up or ground to pieces be ueatli the trucks, heaicheis tins after noon are
          continually finding fragments of cuarred bodies within the theater. The ice is banked up
          against the rear wall, which has buckled out, towering I'ar above the stage ruins. Giant
          props alone prevent a fail, which must come it the wind blows strong. TALK OF ARRESTS.
          CHICAGO, DISC. 31.- -Chief of Police O'.Neil resented the suggestions ot persons who were
          demanding the arrest of the owners of the theater. He refused to com-' ply with the
          demand. He said that if he believed any of the syndicate owning the theater intended to
          leave the city he would arrest them, as they are required at the coroner's inquest. The
          playhouse was the pride of the syn dicate and the calamity will doubtless have a
          depressing effect on all theatrical pro ductions under its control. The managers ol the
          Powers and Illi nois theaters closed their houses last night and are undecided when they
          will reopen. They are owned by the same people as the Iroquois. The syndicate owning the
          Iroquois the ater will hold a meeting today to discuss the advisability of closing until
          the horror is effaced from the public mind. PATHETIC SCENES. CHICAGO, Dec.
          31.—Identification this afternoon is very slow. Fully 99 per cent of the unidentified dead
          are girls ranging in age from 9 to 17 years. There are less men and boys among the dead,
          and prob ably a score of women past the age of 20. A pathetic identification was made to
          day when Dr. Alexander, who searched among the dead all night, recognized the headless
          trunk of his 8-year-old son by a watch he had given him for Christmas. E. Frady, president
          of the Stronge Piano company, has identilied two out of a theater party ot six given by

          this afternoon issued a proclama tion suspending all New Year fettivi ties. Tomorrow will
          be a day ot mourn ing. Saturday will be set aside by the supplementary proclamation.
          IJusiness will be suspended during the religious services that will be held. In order to
          end the death march of sor row which is being made by hundreds from morgue to morgue,
          Chief O'Neil has re quested the coroner to remove all uniden tified l>odies to the
          Coliseum, turing the huge structure into one great morgue. This will probably be done. The
          police hope to have half of the dead identified by night. Of the other half many will
          never be known, so charred and distorted are the features. CHICAGO, Dec. 31.—Hospitals,
          police stations and the morgues are (tacked with the mangled, crushed and burned bodies of
          the dead from the Irpquois theater fire, which occurred yesterday afternoon. The counted
          now numbers 591 persons, but it is believed that many more bodies are still in the ruined
          building. The count was practically complete last midnight, but there are inaccuracies,
          and it is believed that many bodies have not been counted. For a time during the height of
          the confusion policemen carried bodies to undertaking establishments and did not report
          the number to the central police station. Of those who lost their lives in the holocaust
          few were actually burned to death. The number that met death in that way ('imposed but a
          small proportion of the dead. The greater number died from being trampled to death by the
          fren zied people who were trying to get out of the theater. In the hallways of the big new
          theater the firemen who entered found heaps nl dead bodiM. In some cases the faces had
          been trampled so that they were beyond identification. Cases were noted where the entire
          body above the waist was ground into pulp by those rush ing to the outer air after the cry
          of fire j had gone up. Many of the dead did not have a, chance TACOMA, WASH., THURSDAY
          EVENING, DECEMBER, 31 1903 to get out of their seats. From the po sitions in which their
          bodies were found they were evidently instantly killed by the first fierce blast that
          followed the catching ot the tire. These bodies wera found on the second floor. Bodies
          wtie lound seated with their faces toward the stage. The eyes were burned out and I the
          faces blackened and burned. it was during the second act of 'Air. Bluebeard' that the lire
          started. It was the first dramatic production in the house, which bad been recently
          completed. In fact, the house had not been fully com pleted. The iron balconies for the
          fire escapes wore up, but the ladders had not yet bsen constructed. This proved to be far
          worse than it there had been no part of the lire escapes up. Frantic men and Women climbed
          out OH these platforms, lmpi'ig to make their escape down the ladder*. Crowds rushed
          behind the first thai Knight this means of escape. When they reached the balconies they
          found that the ladders had not been put in place and they Here helpless. A struggling mob
          was behind them and thin air in front. Many were thrown off the balconies and were either
          killed or maimed by falling into the alleys and streets below. The lire is thought to have
          been started by a grounded electric wire. The flames first ignited the gas tanks used in
          the calcium light apparatus on the stage and explosions resulted. Hardy had the tire
          started than a loud explosion was heard. A sheet of flame ehct out over the heads of the
          auditors on the first floor and struck those in the balcony full in the laces. It w.is
          there that the dead were found in their seats as they had sat during the play a few
          minutes before. Alter the fire started, Eddie Koy, the chief comedian with the company,
          shout ed to lower the asbestos curtain. The htngi! liai.il>, started to do this, bin
          w+ieTT it was half-way down it stuck and before it could be started again the flames had
          driven them from the stage. V.'ill .1. Davis, manager of the theater, lias made the
          statement that had the cur tain been dropped soon enough no one would have been killed.
          While it is be lieved that the fact that the curtain was up had considerable to do with
          the loss of life, it was not wholly responsible. One of the first to discover that the
          blaze had started was a man whose first thought was to cry 'Fire' as loud aa his lungs
          would permit. The people on the lower floor where he was rose as one and started for the
          exit. It was after they had reached their feet that the sheet of flame shot over their
          heads and did its deadly work on the second floor. The maddened people rushed over each
          other and many were left dead underfoot in the rush. After the alarm reached the outside
          the first to enter the building was a newspaper man and a fireman. It was but ten min utes
          after the fire started that they made their entrance into the building, but dur ing those
          brief minutes nearly 600 people had lost their lives. The fireman and the newspaper man
          crawled up a stairway leading to a bal cony. They held wet handkerchiefs over their faces
          to prevent suffocation. As the two reached the door of the balcony the fireman gasped for
          breath and in horror remarked to his companion, 'For (Jod's make, man, don't walk on their
          faces.' The thick smoke had blinded them and without knowing it they were walking on the
          faces of the dead. Thousands of fren zied men and women had walked over the bodies before
          and some of them were trampled into bloody heaps of shapeless matter. The door they wanted
          to enter, leading from the stairway to the balcony, was blocked so that they could not
          force it. They returned and reported to Chkf Mnabam of the fire department the awful find
          they had made. The chief at once ■topped work on the lower floor and sent all available
          men to the second floor. The dour that had resisted the effort* of the fireman and the
          newspaper man to enter was blocked on the inner side by stacks of dead bodies packed as
          high as the top of the door. A stream of men carried I lie (lead out of the building and
          to the Thomson restaurant, which is next door. The manager of the cafe put all available
          •pace at the service of the firemen and police. The restaurant was transformed into a
          morgue in less than ten minutes. All of the city ambulances, patrol wag ons and other
          conveyance! were inadequate to carry off the injured and take the dead to the morgues. The
          big merchants in the neighborhood of the theater sent wag on loads of linen, cotton and
          blankets for the injured and lent every assistance pos sible. Physicians stood at the
          entrance of the theater and when a body that appeared to have the least sign of life wj J
          taken out il was examined by them. If dead it wag placed in a pile at the side of the
          entrance, and if alive it was whirled away to a hospital or a physicians' office in the
          neigh borhood. 1 Every manner of conveyance carried away the dead from the scene of I One
          large truck was so heavily loaded wilh dead bodies that the horses could no: until the
          police had helped start the wheels. 'There was no need of any loss of life,' said Will .1.
          Davis, manager of the {he ater. 'There were 40 exits and the build ing was fireproof.
          Someone in the audi ence yelled lire and in the wild stampede occurred th» Teat loss of

The citizens •of Chicago are dazed by the awful catastrophe, The speed with which it came and went staggered belief. The news spread with great rap idity and before the lire was out the streets for blocks in either direction wer« jammed with people. Some were looking lor wives-, sweethearts or children. Others were there from idle curiosity. All were struggling to get near the,theater and it required every policeman who could be (.pared to be on the spot. The, building stands on Rudolph street between State and Dearborn streets. No one was allowed to enter the street on which the theater is located for a quarter of a mile on either side of the theater. V The lire itself was put out by the firemen in a short time. Eddie Foy, the comedian, says that the sticking of the curtain saved the lives of the members, of the company, though their salvation was paid for with the lives of those iii the audience. j 'After 11 called for the fire curtain,' said Foy, 'I roused the members of the company, some of whom were almost suf focated by the smoke.' They all got out into the alley. The asbestos curtain re fused to come down and that is what saved us all. If those tanks had exploded when the curtain was down not one ol us would have lived. There would have been no escape from the lire, smoke and gas, and all would have been doomed.

          recovered from 1 the Iroquois holo caust and. found 591, with a prospect of discovering
          others in the debris. It is al most certain that the total number will exceed 600. The
          coroner still believes that the total will reach 700, as the basement and upper dressing
          rooms of the stage and part of the upper galleries have not been thorough ly searched. At
          the city hall lists of the victims and descriptions of the unidentified dead were being
          compiled. Sobbing men, women and children throng the corridors. The death list is being
          added to by reports from the hospitals where the injured were taken. The police believe
          that at least 250 persons were injured. Pumps are working in the basement, which is
          flooded. At every step in the building the police find diamonds, jewels and furs. No one
          i* per mitted to enter the building without a special permit from the chief of police and
          accompanied by a special guard. Thoir sands of dollars' worth of wraps and jew els have
          been hauled to police headquar ters. The rear and side walls of the stage are in danger of
          falling. Architects today warned the firemen that the rear of the building might collapse
          at any moment and crush to death all persons working in that portion of it. William Dee, a
          wealthy contractor, whose two children, Edward, aged 6, and Louise, aged 3, and their
          nurse, were miss ing, chartered a special train from Mecca, Ind., today. He found the
          nurse and Louise. The latter was picked up cry ing in the street in front of the theater.
          The nurse, badly injured, was found in a hospital. The boy is missing. Mayor Harrison this
          morning received the following telegram from President Rrosevelt: i: 'In common with all
          our people through out the land, I extend through you to the people of Chicago my deepest
          sympathy in the catastrophe which has befallen them.'

          I HARRISON TO BLAME For the Non-Enforcement of City Fire Or dinances Applicable to All
          Chicago Theaters. With Nothing Else to Do but En- force the Laws, He Enforced None of
          Them. The Mayor Should Be Held Responsible for the Loss of Nearly a Thousand Lives. Even
          After the Disaster He Says that the Iroquois Theater Was Chicago' s Safest. If the Iroquois
            Theater Was the Safest One, the Others Were Pretty Bad. The expected lias happened. For
            over u year Thu Fagle has been callliiK nttfiitlon. nearly every week, ,to -tlii fni't

          Hall the tire ordlnanee applicable to theaters ap pears to have heeu iihoi! as a elnli to,
          compel (the theaters to give up It next i heats on free passes to City Hall people. i The
          Mayor, since IiIm llrst election nearly seven years iiijo, has never bothered .himself
          about enforcing city ordinances. Ho has leen eontent to draw 10,000 n yeiir for the tlmt
          Job, public or prl vate, that he Iiuh ever held In bin life. Holng a man without any
          private business or profession to attend to, one would think that he, of all others, would
          have time to devote to his, of. llclal duties sutllcleut to see that the ordinance,
          safeguarding the lives of our citizens, were properly enforced. lint he has enforced none
          of lljoin. Whenever the City Council has tti U- fciioii a vacation, he has left town. lie
          loves to loaf. When thu Iroquois lire was burning up almost u thousand of his follow
          citizens, the .Mayor was 'hunting in Oklahoma.' Under this man Harrison's disgrace ful
          administration tho subordinate bu Yeaus of the city government have been permitted to run
          themselves. (Jral't lias held sway, and holds sway In uvcry department of thu city. When
          an 'lection approaches, thu Mayor sots up a yell that 'tho streets belong to the people'
          and Bets jo- elected under false promise.. After election lio relapse Into his
          cold-blooded sloth and gives up thn streets to thugs nnd the people to tho Haines! Ho Is
          tho only Mayor In all Chris tendom under avIiomi iidmlulstr.itlou decent burial has been
          denied to tho honored dead. .Under tho reign of this demagogue ns Mayor, Ave havo Been,
          within thu '.pa&t month, funeral Htopped, hearses attacked In tho streets, and mourners
          compelled to walk to funerals, for lack of pollco protection. Returning from his 'limit,
          lug' bum to Oklahoma on Xew Year's day. this cold blooded creature had the effront eiy to
          Miy In mi Interview in the nub Jtc press, about the theater which no other Mayor would
          have permitted to open: 'The Iro(ttols Theater was the saf est In the city.' What mi
          admission! If tho Iroquois Theater was the saf est in the city what of the others? Why
          were they permitted to run? Mayor Harrison was Informed by the Uulldlin; Commissioner,
          Oeorge Williams, months ao that the theaters were violating thu laws and ordi nances. Did
          Harrison act upon this report by enforcing the laws and ordinances? Xo. He shirked his
          duty entirely ami turned the whole report over to the City Council!' The City Council was
          not elected to enforce the laws. Harrison was elected to enforce' them. What then avus bis
          object in hand lug the report over to the City Coun cil? Did he wish to have the City Coun
          cil repeal the ordinances which the theaters were violating? It certainly looks like It.
          if Chief of Police. O'Neill made a report to the Mayor to the effect tlmt J saloons wero
          violating the law, or that hand books were running in Home places, would thu Mayor send
          the re lort to tho City Council? The truth appears to bo that Harri son did not want to
          enforce the ordi nances in regard to theaters. If he ha A he could have done so. The
          following sections of the build ing ordinance of the city of Chicago were violated hi the

          During tho Harrison political administration of the llulldlug Department, tlie Columbia
          Theater burned up, the whole place being destroyed In a few minutes. Fortunately there was
          no performance at the time. If there had been, 1,(100 lives would have been lost at least.
          After every fatal tire under tho present Harrison administration, the City Council has
          gone Into hysterics with amendments to the building ordinance. The published records of
          the Council proceedings bear this fact out. When the excitement blew over things went on
          as usual, So they will go on now. Tlie Iroquois victims will remain unavenged nnd will

          tlu' Muynr'rt pals, Alderman Mavor, does not share In the Mnyor.'s Idea that the Iroquois
          was the safest theater in Chicago. Here Is AVhat Mavor said about tho Iroquois, after tho
          tire: 'This theater should never have been allowed to open because the law commands that

          Chicago Eagle, Over and Over Again, Called His Attention to Fire Traps. The Following
          Extracts from the Files of This Paper Recall the Damning: Facts. How the Mayor Can Hope to
          Escape His Just Punishment Is a Mystery. He Should Be Arrested Under the Char ter
          Provision for Not Enforcing the Law, And Should Be Removed from Office Upon Being Found
          Guilty in a Coiirt. Harrison has been warned often enough, that his non-enforcement of the
          lire ordinances was a menace to public life. That awful lire trap, the Columbia theater,
          which Harrison permitted to inn wide open, burned from pit to roof In llftoou minutes on
          Monioo street. Fortunately there aviis no per formance ut the time and 1.000 lives that
          would surely have boon lost other- No, were saved. Of course the City Council at once made
          a bin If at amending thu lire or dinances. (See Council proceedings.) Hut jio
          noii-onforceinent of the or dinances by the mayor still continued. The Orpheum Theater,
          opposite the city hall, on Washington street, limn ed from pit to roof, under Harrison's
          adiu'iilstratlou. Fortunately no audi ence was In It at the time. Hut tho attention of the
          public aviis called to Harrison's nou-euforcoinent of the tiro am) building ordinance's, A
          public howl; otllclal hypocritical cant from Harrison, and nothing done as usual. The St.
          Luke's Sanitarium. 'Jlst street and Wabash avenue, burned. '1 Aventy-nlne lives Avere
          lost. Includ ing a member of thu Hoard of Alder men. .More amendments to the tiro ordi
          nance. More apathy and neglect of duty on the part of tlie mayor. The Lincoln Hotel on
          Madison street burned. IVenty-two lives lost. The oidluanco violated. Moro howl. More
          non-enforcement by the mayor. These things showed Mayor Harri son's laxity In u convincing
          Avay. The Chicago Ragle frequently called Mayor Harrison's attention to tlie non
          enforcement of the laws governing theaters, as our readers avIII recollect and as the
          following extracts from our tiles plainly prove: From the Chicago Fugle, .Taiiuary llioa:

        <text>OPPOSE THEATER OPENING. Organized Movement in Chicago Against the Iroquois Managers. h
          CHICAGO, September 17.-An appeal to 3 the clergy of Chicago to arouse feeling of d
          condemnation for the reopening of the Iro quolse Theater has been Issued by the Iro quois
          Memorial Association. The organiza e tion held a special meeting, at which an open letter
          of protest was prepared. This recounts the fire horror in the, theater last December and
          urges the ministers to op pose the further use of the building as a place of amusement.
          More than 3,000 teachers last spring 3 signed a similar petition and at the same time
          thousands of signatures of citizens E were received. While the association was preparing
          Its protest the theater building was being in spected by city oftcials. Building Inspector
          t Keeling will maks a final examination to day, when it is believed a license will be
          Issued. President James J. Reynolds of the me morial association asked Acting Corpora tion
          Counsel Sexton for permission to have the association architect make an Inspec tion of the
          theater before a license is granted. Mr. Sexton said he thought the plan would not be
          opposed. The clubs of children which are working for the Iroquois Memorial Emergency Hos
          pital fund have raised *$,800 In the last two months. Acting Building Commissioner
          Stanhope today approved the application of the Hyde Behman Music Hall for a license to con
          duct a theater In the building formerly oc cupied by the Iroquois Theater.</text>

        <text>THE IROQUOIS. Even as Sir Arthur and John Law clasped hands, there came a sudden in
          terruption. A half-score yards deeper in the wood there arose a sudden, luilf choked cry,
          followed by a shrill whoop. There was a crashing as of one run ning, and immediately there
          pressed into the open space the figure of an Indian, an old man from the village ot the
          Illini. Even as his staggering footsteps brought him within gaze, the two startled
          observers saw the shaft which had sunk deep within his breast. He had been shot through by
          an In dian arrow, and upon the instant it was all t.oo plain whose hand had sped the
          shaft. Following close upon his heels there came a stalwart savage, whose face, hideously
          painted, appeared fairly demoniacal as he came bounding on with uplifted hatchet, seeking
          to strike down the victim already impaled by the silent arrow. 'Quick!' cried Law, in a
          flash catch ing the meaning of this sudden spec tacle. 'Into the fort, Sir Arthur, and
          call the men together!' Not stopping to relieve the struggles of the victim, who had now
          fallen forward, gasping, Law sprang on with drawn blade to meet the advancing savage. The
          latter paused for an un certain moment, and then with a shrill yell of defiance, hurled
          the keen steel hatcher full at Law's head. It shore away a piece of his hat brim, and sank
          with edge deep buried in the trunk of a tree beyond. The savage turned, but turned too
          late. The blade of the swordsman passed through from rib to rib under his arm, and he fell
          chok ing, even as he sought again to give vent to his war cry. And now arose in the woods
          beyond, and in the fields below the hill, and from the villages of the neighborln Indians,
          a series of sharp, undulating .veils. Shots came from within the lortress. where the
          loop-holes were al ready manned. There were borne from the nearest wigwams of the Illini
          the screams of wounded men, the shrieks of terrified women. In an instant the peaceful
          spot had become the scene of a horrible confusion. Once more the wolves of the woods, the
          Iroquois, had fallen on their prey! Swift as tied been Law's movements. Pembroke was but a
          pace behind him as he wrenched free his blade. The two turned back together and started at
          speed for the palisade. At the goto they met others hurrying in. Pern broke's men joining
          in the rush of the frightened villagers. Among these the Iroquois pressed with shrill
          yells, ply ing i nife and bow and hatchet as they ran, and the horrified eyes of those
          within the palisade saw many a trag edy enacted. 'Watch the gate!' cried Pierre Noir, from
          his station in the corner tower. As he spoke there came a rush of screaming Iroquois, who
          sought to gain the entrance. 'Now!' cried Pierre Noir, discharg ing his piece into the
          crowded ranks below him; and shot after shot fol lowed his own. The packed brown mass gave
          back and resolved itself in to scattered units, who broke and ran for the nearest cover.
          'They will not come on again until dark,' said Pierre Noir, calmly, lean ing his piece
          against the wall. 'There fore I may attend to certain little mat ters.'' He passed out
          into the entry-way, ■where lay the bodies of three Iroquois, abandoned, under the close
          and dead ly fire, hv their companions where the; hid fallen. When Pierre Noir re turned
          and cilmly propped up again the door ot slabs which lie had re moved. he carried in his
          hand three tufts of Iona black hair, from which dripped heavy gouts of blood. 'Good God.
          man!' said Pembroke. 'You must not be savage as these In dians! 'Speak for yourself.
          Monsieur An glais,' replied Pierre, stoutly. 'You need not save these head pieces if you
          do not care for them. For myself, tis part of the trade.' 'Assuredly,' broke in Jean
          Breboeuf. We keep these trinkets, we voya ge ars of the French. Make no dor i t lhat Jean

          sark ragr f ing man now ris ing hot blood. 'And look! Here com* ore chances for our little
          ortiernen* Pierre Noir for once had been mis taken and overestimated the courage of the
          warriors of the Onondagos. Lashing themselves to fury at the thought of their losses, they
          came on again, now banding and charging in the open close up to the walls of the palisade.
          Again the little party of whites maintained a steady fire, and again Hit Iroquois, baffled
          and enraged, fell bac. .nto the wood, whence they poured \oiiey after volley rattling
          against the walls of the sturdy fortress. 'I am sorry, sir,' said Sorgt. Gray to Pembroke,
          'but 'tis all up with me.' The poor teilow staggered against the wall, and in a few
          moments all was indeed o\er with him. A chance shot had piert ed his chest. 'Pf-sie! If
          this keeps up,' said Pierre Noir, 'there will not be many of us left by morning. I never
          saw them fight so well. 'Tis a good watch we'll need this night.' In fact, all through the
          night the Iroquois tried every stratagem of their savage warfare. With ear-splitting yells
          they came close up to the stock ade, and in one such charge two or three of their young
          men even man aged to climb to the tops of the point ed stakes, though but to meet their
          death at the muzzles of the muskets within. Then there arose curving lines of fire from
          without the walls, half cir cles which terminated at last in lift' jarrin' thuds, where
          blazing nrro I P end stood in log. or earth, or un protected roof. These projectile«,
          wrapped with lighted birch bar 1 served as fire brands, and dancer cm. gh they carried.
          Yet, after some fashion, the little garrison kept down these incipient blazes, held
          together the terrified Illini, repulsed each re pealed charge of the Iroquois, and so at
          last wore through the long and, fearful night. The sun was just rising across the tops of
          the distant groves when the Iroquois made their next advance. It rame not in the form of a
          concerted attack, but of an appeal for peace. A party of the savages left their cover and
          approached the fortress, waving their hands above their heads. One of them presently
          advanced alone. 'What is it, Pierre?' asked Law. 'What does the fellow want?' 'I care not
          what he wants,' said Pierre Noir, carefully adjusting the lock of his piece and steadily
          regard ing the savage as he approached; 'but I'll wager you a year's pay he never gets
          alive past yonder stump.' 'Stay!' cried Pembroke, catching at the barrel of the leveled
          gun. 'I believe he would talk with us.' 'What does he say. Pierre?' asked Law. 'Speak to
          him, if you can.' 'He wants to know,' said, Pierre, as the messenger at length stopped and
          began a harangue, 'whether we are English or French. He says something about there being a
          big peace between Corlaer and Onontio; by which he means, gentlemen, the governor at New
          York and the governor at Que bec.' 'Tell him,' cried Pembroke with p sudden thought,
          'that. I am an officer ol' Corlaer, and that Corlaer bids the Iroquois to bring in all the
          prisoner;: they have ta! en. Tell him that the French are going to give up ail their
          prisoners to us. and that the Iroquois mt'fi 1er.' e the war path, or my Lord Bellornonl.
          will tr.i.e the w?.r trail and wipe their Wages off the earth.' Something in this speech
          as con veyed to tb° jev-iee seemed to give him a certain oucern. He retiree, and presently
          his place was ta!,'en by a tall and stately figure, dressed in the full habiliments of an
          Iroquois chieftain. He came on calmly and proudly, his head erect, and in his ex tended
          hand the long-stemmed pipe of peace. Pierre Noir heaved a deep sigli of relief. 'Unless my
          eyes deceive me,' said he, 'tis old Teganisoris himself, one of the head men of the
          Onondagos. If so, there is some hope, for Teganisoris is wdse enough to know when peace is
          best.' It was, indeed, that noted chieftain of the Iroquois who now advanced close up to
          the wall. Law and Pem broke stepped out to meet him beyond the palisade, the old voyageur
          still serving as interpreter from the plat form at their back. 'He says—listen,
          messieurs!—he says he knows there Is going to be a big peace; that, the Iroquois are tired
          of fighting and that their hearts are sore. He says—a most manifest lie. I beg you to
          observe, messieurs— thaï he loves the English, and that, al though he ought to kill the
          French men of our garrison, he will, since some of us are English, and hence his friends,
          spare us all if we will cease to fight.' Pembroke turned to Law with ques tion In his eye.
          'There must be something done,' said the latter in a low tone. 'We were short enough of
          ammunition Imre even before Du Mesne left, for the set j tlements. and your own men have
          none j too much left.' 'Reflect! Bethink yourselves, Eng lishmen!' he says to us,'
          continued j Pierre Noir. 'We came to make war upon the Illini. Our work here is done. 'Tis
          time now that we went hack to our villages. If there is to be 1 a big peace, the Iroquois
          must he there; for unless the Iroquois demand it, there can he no peace at all.' And.
          gentlemen, I beg you to remember it is an Iroquois who is talking, and that the truth is
          not in the tongue of an Iroquois.'</text>

          Pierre Noir, that we are all English and that we are not afraid; and that if we are
          harmed, the armies of Corlaer will de stroy the Iroquois, even as the Iro quois have the
          Illini. Tell him that we will go back with him to the set tlements because we are willing
          to go that way upon a journey which we Lai already planned. We could fight loi e. er if we
          chose, and he ran see lor himself by the bodies of his young men how well we are able to
          make war.' ll is well,' replied Teganisoris. 'You have the word of an Iroquois that this
          shall he done, as 1 have said.' 'the word of an Iroquois!' cried Pie:re Noir, slamming
          down the butt ot ii.s musket. 'The word of a snake, say rather! Jean Breboeuf, harken you
          to what our leaders have agreed! We are to go as prisoners of the Iro quois! Mary, Mother
          of God, what folly! And there is madame, and la pauvre petite, that infant so young. By
          God! Were it left to me, Pierre Berthier would stand tiere and fight to the end. I know
          these Iroquois!' I CHAPTER XXVIII. PRISONERS OF THE IROQUOIS. The faith of the Iroquois
          was worse than Punic, nor was there lacking swift proof of its real nature. Law and
          Pembroke, the moment they had led their little garrison beyond the gate, found themselves
          surrounded by a ring ol tomahawks and drawn bows. Their weapons were snatched away from
          them, and on the instant they found themselves beyond all possibil ity of that resistance
          whose giving over they now bitterly repented. Teg anisoris regarded them with a sar donic
          smile. 'I see you are all English,' said he, 'though some of you wear blue coats. These we
          may perhaps adopt into our tribe, for our boys grow up but slowly, and some of the blue
          coats are good fighters. These dogs of Illini we shall ol' course burn. As for your war
          house, you will no longer need it, since you are now friends of the Iroquois, and are
          going to their villages. You may say to Corlaer that you well know tlie Iroquois have no
          prisoners.' The horrid significance of this threat was all too soon made plain. In an hour
          the little stockade was hut a mass or embers and ashes, tn another hour tlie little valley
          had beeome a Gehenna ol anguish and lamentations, with whose riot of grief and woe there
          mingled the savage exultations of a foe whose treachery was but surpassed by bis cruelty.
          Again the planting ground of the Illini was utterly laid waste, to mark It naught
          remaining but trampled grain, and heaps of ashes, and remnants of blackened and incin
          erated hones. By nightfall the party of prisoners had begun a wild journev Vl,ro.iip,
          wilderness, whose horrors surpk'''d any they had supposed to be humanly endurable. Bay
          after day, week after week, for more tir o month, and much of the time in winder weather,
          they toiled on, part of tin way by boat, Ihe remaln uer of the journey on foot, crossing
          snow-clogged forest, and tangled thicket and frozen morass, yet daring not to drop out for
          rest, since to lag might nn an to die. It was as though after some frightful nightmare of
          suf fering and di pair that at length they reached the v illages of the Five Na tions,
          located far to the east, at the foot of the great waterway which Law and liis family had
          ascended more than a year before. Yet if that wit ich had gone before seemed lit e some
          bitter dream, surely the day of awakening promised but lit tle better hope. From village
          to vil lage, footsore and ill, they were hur ried without rest, at each new stopping place
          tin' central figuses of a barbar ous triumph: and nowhere did they meet the n Unlives of
          either tbf French or English government. whoso v i presence had consti tuted tin*' round

          own village, after the triumphal j progress among the tribes had at length been concluded.
          'Since they have sent us no pres ents,' said he, with that daring di plomacy which made
          him a leader in red statesmanship, 'let those who stayed at home be given some prisoner in
          pay for those of their people who have been lulled. Moreover, let us of fer to the Great
          Spirit some sacrifice in propitiation; since surely the Great Spi r it is offended.' Such
          was the con clusion of this head man of the Onon dagos, and fateful enough it was to the
          prisoners. The great gorge through which poured the vast waters of the northern seas was a
          spot not always visited by those passing up the great lakes for I lie western stations,
          nor down the lakes to the settlements of the St. Lawrence. Yet there was a trail which led
          around the great cataract, and the occasional coureurs de hois, or the passing friars, or
          the adventurous mer chants of the lower settlements now and again left that trait, and
          came to look, upon the tremendous scene of the great falling of the waters. Here where the
          tumult ascended up to heaven, and where the white-blown wreaths of mist might indeed, even
          in an imagination better than that of a savage, have been construed into actual forms of
          spirits, the Indians had, from time immemorial, made their offerings to the genius of the
          cataract—strips of rude cloth, the skin of the beaver and the otter, baskets woven of
          sweet grasses, and, after the advent of the white man, pieces of metal or strings of
          precious beads. Such valued things as these were in rude adoration placed upon rocks or
          uplifted scaffolds near to the brink of the abyss. This was Ihe spot most commonly chosen
          by the medicine man in the pursuit of his in cantations. It was tlie church, the wild and
          savage cathedral of the red men. Following now the command of their chieftain, the
          Iroquois left their sta tionary lodges and moved in a body, pitching a temporary camp at a
          spot not far from the falls. Here, in a sreat council lodge, the older men sat in
          deliberation for a full day and night. The dull drum sounded continually, tlie council
          pipe went round, and the warriors besought the spirits to give them knowledge. Tlie savage
          hysteria, little by little, yet steadily, arose high er and higher, until at length it
          reached that point of frenzy where naught otild suffice save some terrible, some
          tremendous thing. Enforced spectators of these curious and ominous ceremonies, Ute
          prisoners looked on, wondering, imagining, liesi- j lating and fearing. 'Monsieur,' said
          Pierre Noir, turning at last to Law, j 'it grieves me to speak, yet 'tis best for you to
          know the truth. It is to be you or Monsieur Pembroke. They will not have me. They say that
          it must I be one of you two great chiefs, for LAW SUNK HIS HEAD. that you were brave, your
          hearts were strong, and that hence you would find favor as the adopted child of the Great
          Spirit who has been offended.' Law looked at Pembroke, and they both regarded Mary
          Connynge and the babe. 'At least,' said Law, 'they spare the woman and tlie child. So Tar
          very well. Sir Arthur, we are at the last hazard.' 'I have asked them to take me,' said
          Pierre Noir, 'for 1 am an old man and have no family. But they will not listen to me.'
          Pembroke passed his hand wearily across his face. 'I have behind me so long a memory of
          suffering,' said he, 'and before me so small an amount of promise, that for myself I am
          content to let it end. It comes to all sooner or later, according to our fate.' 'You
          speak,' said Law, 'as though it were determined. Yet Pierre says it will not be both of
          us, but one.' Pembroke smiled sadly. 'Why, sir,' said he, 'do you think me so sorry a
          fellow as that? Look!' and he pointed to Mary Connynge and the child. 'There is your
          duty.' Law followed his gaze, and his look was returned dumbly by the woman who had played
          so strange a part in the late passages of his life. Never a word with her had Law spoken
          re garding his plans or concerning what he had learned from Pembroke. As j to this, Mary
          Connynge had been afraid to ask, nor dare ask even now. 'Besides,' went on Pembroke later,
          as he called Law aside, 'there is some thing to be done—not here, but over there, in
          England, or in France. Your duty is involved not only with this woman. You must find
          sometime the other woman. You must see the Lady Catharine Knollys.' Law sunk his head
          between his hands and groaned bitterly. 'Go you rather,' said he, 'and spend your life for
          her. I choose that it should end at once, and here.' 'I have not been wont to call Mr. Law
          a coward,' said Pembroke, sim ply. 'I should be a coward if I should stand aside and allow
          you to sacrifice yourself; nor shall I do so,' replied the other. 'They say,' broke in
          Pierre Noir, who had been listening to the excited harangues of first one warrior and then
          another, 'that both warriors are great chiefs, and that both should go to gether.
          Teganisoris insists that only one shall lie offered. This last has been almost agreed; but
          which one of you 'tis to be lias not yet been deter mined.' Dawn came through the narrow
          door and open roof holes of the lodge. The rising of the sun seemed to tiring con viction
          to the Iroquois. All at once (lie savage council broke tip and scat tered into groups,
          which hurried to different parts of the village. Pres ently these reappeared at tlie
          central lodge. There sounded a concerted sav age chant. A ragged column appeared, whose
          head was faced toward the cat aract. There were those who bore strings of beads and strips
          of fur, even the prized treasures of tlie tufted scalp locks, whose tresses, combed
          smooth, were adorned with colored cloth and feathers. Pierre Noir was silent; yet, as the
          captives looked, they needed no advice that the sacrificial procession was now forming.
          'They said,' began Pierre Noir, at length, with trembling voice, turning hia eyes as he
          spoke, 'that it could not be myself, that it must be one of you, and but one. They are
          going to cast lots for it. It is Teganisoris who has proposed that the lots shall be
          thrown by—' Pierre Noir faltered, unwilling to go on. 'And by whom?' asked Law, quietly.
          'By—by the woman—by madame!' CHAPTER XXIX. THE SACRIFICE. There was sometimes practiced
          among the Iroquois a game which bore a certain resemblance to the casting of dice, as tlie
          latter is known among civilized peoples. The method of the play was simple. Two oblong
          polished bones, of the bigness of a man's finger, were used as the dice. The ends of these
          were ground thin and were rude ly polished. One of the dice was stained red, the other
          left white. The players in tlie game marked out a line on the hard ground, and then each
          in turn cast up the two dice into the air, throwing them from some receptacle. The game
          was determined by the fall ing of the red bone, he who cast this colored bone closer to
          the line upon the ground being declared the winner. The game was simple, and depended much
          upon chance. If the red die fell fiat upon its face at a point near tr the line, it was
          apt to lie close to tilt spot where it dropped. On the othei hand, did it alight upon
          either end, it might hound back and fail at some lit tle distance upon oYte side of the
          line. It was this game which, in horrible fashion, Teganisoris now proposed tc play. He
          offered to the clamoring medicine man and his ferocious disci ples one of these captives,
          whose death should appease not only the offended Great Spirit, but also the unsated
          vengeance of the tribe. He offered, ai the same time, the spectacle of a play in which a
          human life should be the stake. He used as practical execution er the woman who was
          possessed by one of them, and who, In the crude no tions of the savages, was no doubt
          coveted by both. It must be the hand of this woman that should cast the dice, a white one
          and a red one for each man, and he whose red die fell closer to the line was winner in the
          grim game of life and death. Jean Breboeuf and Pierre Noir stood apart, and tears poured
          from the eyes of both. They were hardened men, well acquainted with Indian warfare; they
          had seen the writhings of tor tured victims, and more than once had faced such
          possibilities themselves; yet never had they seen sight like this. Near the two men stood
          Mary Con nynge, the bright blood burning in her cheeks, her eyes dry and wide open,
          looking from one to the other. God, who gives to this earth the few Mary Connynges, alone
          knows the nature of those elements which made her, and the character of the conflict which
          now went, on within her soul. Tell such a woman as Mary Connynge t'liat she has a rival,
          and she will either love the more madly the man whom she de mands as her own, or with
          equal mad ness and with greater intensity will hate her lover with a hatred undying and
          unappeasable. Mary Connynge stood, her eyes glancing from one to the other of the men
          before her. She had seen them both proved brave men, strong of arm, undaunted of heart,
          both gallant g n tlemen. God, who makes th' Mary Connynges of this earth, only -mu tell
          whether or not there aros 'he heart of this savage women o man at bay, scorned, reb »3
          tered, this one question: If Mary Connynge hated John 1 if she loved him—ah! how n e
          pulsed her heart in agony, terness, as she took into her lr»n so lots which were the
          arbiters Ife and death! Teganisoris looked about him md spoke a few rapid words. He caught
          Mary Connynge roughly by the shoul- I der and pulled her forward. The two men stood with
          faces set and gray in the pitiless light of morn. Their arms were fast bound behind their
          backs. Eagerly the crowding savages pressed up to them, gesticulating wildly, and peering
          again and again into their faces to discover any sign of weak ness. They failed. The pride
          of birth, the strength of character, the sheer animal vigor of each man stood him in stead
          at this ultimate trial. Each had made up his mind to die. Each proposed, not doubling that
          he would he the one to draw the fatal lot, to die as a man and a gentleman. Teganisoris
          would play this game with all possible mystery and impor tance. It should be tolii
          generations hence about the council fir^s. how he. Teganisoris. devised this gums, how he
          played it, how he drew it out link by link to the last atom of It* ec-ony. There was no
          receptacle» at h-nd in which the dice could be placed. Te ganisoris stooped, and without
          cere mony wrenched from Mary Connynge's foot the moccasin which covered it— the little
          shoe—beaded, beautiful, and now again fateful. Sir Arthur smiled as though in actual joy.
          'My friend,' said he. 'I have won! This might be the very slipper for which we played at
          the Green Lion long ago.' Law turned upon him a face pale and solemn. 'Sir.' said he. '1
          pray God that this issue may not be as when wc last played. I pray God that the dice may
          elect me and not yourself.' 'You were ever lucky in the games of chance,' replied
          Pembroke. 'Too lucky,' said Law. 'But the winner here is the loser, if it be my self.'
          Teganisoris roughly took from Mary Connynge's hand the little hits of hone. He cast them
          into the hollow of the moccasin and shook them dra matically together, holding them high
          above his head. Then he lowered them and took out front the receptacle two of the dice. He
          placed his hand on Law's shoulder, signifying that his was to be the first cast. Then he
          handed back the moccasin to the woman. Mary Connynge took the shoe in her hand and stepped
          forward to the line which had been drawn upon the ground. The red spots still burned up on
          her cheeks; her eyes, amber, feline, still flamed hard and dry. She still glanced rapidly
          from one to the other, her eye as lightly quick and as bril liant as that of the crouched
          cat about to spring. Which? Which would it be? Could she control this game? Could she
          elect which man should live and which should die—tills woman, scorned, abased, mastered?
          Neither of these sought to read the riddle of her set lace and blazing eyes. Each as he
          might offered his soul to Ms Creator. The hand of Mary Connynge was raised above her head.
          Her face was turned once more to John Law, her master, her commander, her repudi ator.
          Slowly she turned the moccasin over in her hand. The white bone fell first, the red for a
          moment hanging in the soft folds of the buckskin. She shook it out. It fell with its face
          near ly parallel to the ground and alighted not more than a foot from the line, re
          bounding scarce more than an inch or so. Low exclamations arose from all around the
          thickened circle. 'As I said, my friend,' cried Sir Arthur, 'I have won! The throw is
          passing close for you.' Teganisoris again caught Mary Con nynge by the shoulder, and
          dragged her a step or so farther along the line, the two dice being left on the ground as
          they had fallen. Once more her hand arose, once more it turned, once more the dice were
          cast. The goddess of fortune still stood faithful to this bold young man who had so often
          confidently assumed her friendship. His life, later to be so in timately concerned with
          this same new savage country, was to be preserved for an ultimate opportunity. The white
          and the red hone fell to gether from the moccasin. Had it been the white that counted, Sir
          Arthur had been saved, for the white bone lay actually upon the line. The red fell almost
          as close, but alighted on Its end. As though impelled by some spirit of evil, it dropped
          upon some little pebble or hard bit of earth, bounded into the air, fell, and rolled quite
          away from the mark! Even on that crowd of cruel savages there came a ^cncc. Of the whites,
          one scarce dared look at the other. Slowly the faces of Pembroke and Law turned one toward
          the other. 'Would God I could shake you by the hand,' said Pembroke. 'Good-by.' 'As for
          you, dogs and worse than dogs,' he cried, turning toward the red faces about him, 'mark
          you! where I stand the feet of the white man shall stand forever, and crush your faces
          into the dirt!' Whether or not the Iroquois under stood his defiance could not be deter
          mined. With a wild shout they pressed upon him. Borne struggling and stumbling by the
          impulse of a dozen hands, Pembroke half walked and half was carried over the distance
          between the village and the brink of the chasm of Niagara. Until then it had not been
          apparent what was to be the nature of his fate, but when he looked upon the sliding floor
          of waters below him, and heard beyond the thunderous voices of the cataract, Pembroke knew
          what was to be his final portion. There was, at some distance above the great falls, a
          spot where descent was possible to the edge of the water. Pembroke's feet .»tre loosened
          and he was compelled to esce. the narrow path. A canoe u red at the shore, and the i u
          young En lishman went pa i< lized what was to be the it. Bound again hand as s, he was cast into the arm sent the tiny craft dstream. The ham!.- waters grasped the frail cockleshell, twisted it about, tossed it. played with it, and claimed it irrevocably for their own. For a few moments it was visible as it passed ou down with the resistless current of the mighty stream. Almost at the verge of the plunge, the eyes watching from the shore saw at a dis tance tlie struggle made by the victim. He half raised himself in the boat and throw himself against its side. It was overset. For one instant the cold sun shone glistening on the wet hark of the upturned craft. It was but a mo ment, and then there was no dot upon the solemn flood. CHAPTER XXX. THE EMBASSY. 'Monsieur! Madame! Pierre Noir! Listen to me! I have saved you! I, Jean Breboeuf, i have rescued you!' So spoke Jean Breboeuf, thrusting his head within the door of t lie lodge in which were the remaining prisoners of the Iroquois. It '.vas indeed Jean Breboeuf who. strollin he. ond the outer edge ot th village, hud been among tlie first i. espy an approaching party of visitor Of any travelers ossible. none con! have been more important to the pris oners.

          to place upon it heavy stones, so that it never again can be dug up. ' Brothers, as you
            know, the great canoes from across the sea are bring ing more and more white men. Look
            about you, and tell me where are your fathers and your brothers and your sons? Half your
          fighting men are gone; and if you turn to the west to seek out strong young men from the
          other tribes, which of them will come to sit by your fires and be your brothers? The war
          trails of the na tions have gone to the west as far as the Great river. All the country
          has been at war. The friends of Onontio beyond Michilimackinac have been so busy fighting
          that they have forgotten to take the beaver, or if they have taken it, they have been
          afraid to bring it down the water trail to us, lest the Iroquois or the English should rob
          them. 'Brothers, a great peace is now de clared. Onontio, the father of all the red men,
          has taken the promises of his children, the Hurons, the Algon quins, the Miamis, the
          Illini, the Outa gamies, the OJibways, all those peo ples who live to the west, that they
          will follow the war trail no more. Next summer there will be a great council. Onontio and
          Corlaer have agreed to call the tribes to meet at the Moun tain in the St. Lawrence.
          Onontio says to you that he will give you back your prisoners, and now he demands that you
          in return give back those whom you may have with you. This is his will; aad if you fail
          him, you know how heavy Is his hand. 'Brothers, I see that you have pris oners here, white
          prisoners. These must be given up to us. I will take them with me when I return. For your
          Indian captives, it is the will of Onon tio that you bring them all to the Great Peace in
          the summer, and that you then, all of you, help to dig the great I I j j i j hill under
          which the hau l et is going to be buried. Then once more our rivers will not be red, and
          will look more like water. The sun will not shine red. but will look as the sun should
          look. The sky will again be blue. Our women and our children will no longer be afraid, and
          you Iro quois can go to sleep in your houses and not dread the arms of the French.
          Brothers, I have spoken. Peace is good.' Teganisoris replied in the same strain as that
          chosen by Joncaire, as suring him that he was his brother; that his heart went out to him;
          that the Iroquois loved the French; and that if they had gone to war with them, it was but
          because the young men df Corlaer had closed their eyes so that they could not see the
          truth. 'As to these prisoners,' said he, 'take them with you. We do not want them with us,
          for we fear they ntay bring us harm. Our medicine man coun seled us to offer up one of
          these pris oners as a sacrifice to the Great Spirit. We did so. Now our medicine man has a
          bad dream. He says that the while men are going to come and tear down our houses and
          trample our fields. When the time comes for the peace, the Iroquois will be at the Moun
          tain. Brother, we will bury the hatchet, and bury it so deep that henceforth none may ever
          again dig It up.' 'It is well,' said Joncaire, abruptly, 'My brothers are wise. Now let
          the council end, for my path is long and I must travel back to Onontio at once.' Joncaire
          knew well enough the fickle nature of these savages, who might the morrow demand another
          council and perhaps arrive at different conclu sions. Hearing there were no white
          prisoners in the villages farther to the west, he resolved to set forth at once upon the
          return with those now at hand. Hurrying, therefore, as soon as might be, to their leader,
          he urged him to make ready forthwith for the journej- hack to the St. Lawrence. 'Unless I
          much mistake, monsieur,' said he to Law, 'you are that same gentleman who so set all
          Quebec by the ears last winter. My faith! The regiment Carignan had cause to re joice when
          you left for up river, even though you took with you half the ready coin of the
          settlement. Yet come you once more to meet the gentlemen of France, and I doubt not they
          will be glad as ever to stake you high as may be in this poverty-stricken region. You have
          been far to the westward, I doubt not. You were, perhaps, made prisoner somewhere below
          the straits.' 'Far below; among the tribe of the Illini, in tlie valley of the Messasebe.'
          'You tell me so! I had thought no white man left in that valley for this season. And
          madame— this child— surely 'twas the first white infant born in the great valley.' 'And
          the most unfortunate.' 'Nay, how can you say that, since you have come more than half a
          thou sand miles and are all safe and sound to-day? Glad enough we shall be to have you and
          madame with us for the winter, if, indeed, it be not for longer dwelling. I cannot take
          you now to the English settlements, since 1 must back to the governor with the news. Yet
          dull enough you would find these Dutch of the Hudson, and worse yet the blue-nosed
          psalmodists of New England. Much better for you and your good lady are the gayer capitals
          of New France, or la belle France it self, that older France. Monsieur, how infinitely
          more fit for a gentle man of spirit is France than your dull England and its Dutch king!
          Either New France or Old France, let me ad vise You; and as to that new west, let me
          counsel that you wait until after the big peace. And, in speaking, your friend, Du Mesne,
          your lieutenant, the coureur —his fate, I suppose, one need not ask. He was killed—where?'
          Law recounted the division of his party just previous to the Iroquois at tack, and added
          his concern lest Du Mesne should return to the former sta tion during the spring and find
          but. its ruins, with no news of the fate of his friends. 'Oh, as to that—'twould be but
          the old story of the voyageurs,' said Jon caire. 'They are used enough to jour neying a
          thousand miles or so, to find the trail end in a heap of ashes, and to the tune of a scalp
          dance. Fear not for your lieutenant, for, believe me, he has fended for himself if there
          has been need. Yet I would warrant you, now that this word for the peace has gone out, we
          «hall see your friend Du Mesne as big as life at the Mountain next summer, knowing as much
          of your history as you yourself do, and quite counting upon meeting you with us on the St.
          Lawrence, and madame as well:' As to that, methinks madame will be better with us on the
          St. Lawrence than on the savage Messasebe. We have none too many dames among us, and I
          need not state, what monsieur's eyes have told him every morning— that a fairer never set
          foot from ship from over seas. Witness my lieutenant yonder, Raoul de LIgny! He is thus
          soon all devotion! Mother of God! but we are well met here, in this wilderness, among the
          savages. Voila, monsieur! We take you again captive, and 'Us madame enslaves us all!'
          There had indeed ensued conversa tion between the young French officer above named and
          Mary Connynge; jet prompt as might have been the former with gallant attentions to so fair
          a captive, it could not have been said that he was allowed the first ad vancea Mary
          Connynge, even after a month of starving foot travel and an other month of anxiety at the
          Iroquois villages, had lost neither her rounded body, her brilliance of eye and color, nor
          her subtle magnetism of personal ity. It had taken stronger head than that of Raoul de
          Ligny to withstand even her slight request How, then, as to Mary Connynge supplicating, en

        <text>tca.O' .iayor Testifies at Iroquois I Theater Fire Inquest. Chicago; Jan.; 14.--Mayor
          Harrison was on the stand. Wednesday in the Iroquois theater fire inquest: His ervf dence
          related chiefly to a report sub mitted .to him by Building Commis stoner Williams which
          declared that none of the theaters in Chicago fully Complied with the terms of the build
          ing ordinance. The mayor described the wanderings of this report, from him to the council,
          from the council to a sub-cgmmittee; from this com mittee bacl to the council and. then to
          the printer. He said no action had *been taken upon it by the council up to the time of-
          the Iroquois' theater fire. The nayor declared that Building Commissioner Williams simply
          re ported to him that there was not a theater in the city of Chicago comply ing with the
          law, but made no recom mendation that they be closed or their licenses revoked. He
          corroborated tbh etnt*ment of Building Commissioner Williams that the office of
          commissioner was poorly supplied with hell because of small appropriations by the city.
          William J. McAllister, secretary of the building department of Chicago, said theie was no
          record kept of the cdestruction of any building save the reports of the' inspectors. About
          a 'dozen of the stage hands and fly men employed in the theater, testified tthat they .had
          never received instructions regarding their duties in case of fire.</text>

        <text>Greatest in Country's History. The Iroquois theater was vastly mora destructive to
          human life than any othe playhouse fire in the history of this country. The fire next to
          it in point of lives lost occurred December 5, 1876, in Conway's Brooklyn theater,
          Brooklyn, N. Y. Here 295 of the audienco perished in fierce flames. The day after Christ
          mas in 1811, while the play, 'The Bleed ing Nun,' was being performed in a theater at
          Richmond, Va., a fire started that burned 70 persons to death, among them the governor of
          the state, George W. Smith. SEARCH FOR THE DEAD Friends and Relatives of Victim Haunt
          Morgues and Hospitals. MANAGERS OF THE IROQUOIS THEATER PLACED UNDER ARREST City Officials
          Also Taken in Cfeargt and Charajed with Manslaughter Many other Theaters Are I Closed by
          the Mayor. Chicago, Jan. 2. The search of th rows of charred dead at the morgues by
          sorrowing friends and relatives con tinues. Over 400 of the 583 known dead now have been
          identified. Failing to find scores of the missing in these heaps of bodies, the search has
          been turned to the private hospitals and homes for more dead and dying. Coro ner Traeger
          has asked all citizens to aid him in this quest. Grief-crazed friends and relatives of the
          missing join in this appeal. Funerals of Victims. The saudest reminders of the Iro quois
          catastrophe Friday were the numerous funerals which moved through the streets in all
          portions of the city. In the homes of hundreds of victims friends gathered to console the
          parents, brothers and sisters whose relatives had been lost. Such a day of mourning
          Cnicago has never witnessed, and sad scenes were enacted in the homes where funeral
          services were conducted over the chil dren. In some homes funeral services were held over
          the body of one nftennk ber of a family while another was ly-S ing in some morgue still
          unidentified by the distracted relatives. Such ,was the case at the home of Herbert and
          Agnes Lange, 1632 Barry avenue. Both children had attended the theater per formance, and
          after many hours of tireless searching the broken-hearted father found the body of his
          daughter, Agnes, in an undertaking establish ment. Then came a longing on the part of
          mother and father to find the body of the boy, Herbert, and the search was conducted the
          entire day. Mr. Lange met with no success, and finally in de spair he went to the office
          of Chief of Police O'Neill and begged Detectives Wooldrldge and Schubert to assist him. He
          also pleaded with newspaper men. He was only one of hundreds who spent the day searching
          for beloved ones, but his appeal for assistance was so full of pathos that intense sympa
          thy was immediately aroused and every effort was made to find the miss ing body. The
          absolute failure of Mr. Lange to identify any of the bodies aroused hope in his heart that
          the lad may still be alive and cared for in some hospital. New Year's day the black
          hearses and the white began their slow way through the city's streets. There are not hear
          .enough to bury the dead; to carry tne charred, distorted bodies from the sorrow-darkened
          homes to the waiting graves in the cemeteries. Thirty-four teachers in the public schools
          are known to have lost their lives in the fire and the schools will be closed Monday in
          their memory. Managers Arrested. Will J. Davis and Harry J. Powers, proprietors and
          managers of the Iro quois theater, and George Williams, city building inspector, were
          placed un der arrest on the criminal charge of manslaughter. Warrants for the three men.
          who have hitherto been unmolest ed by police and coroner investigations of the
          catastrophe, were issued Friday night by Justice George W. Under wood. Theaters Closed.
          Seventeen Chicago theaters were closed peremptorily by Mayor Har rison Friday night
          because they were not equipped with asbestos drop cur tains. This action following on the
          heels of the Iroquois disaster, shuts one half of the playhouses in Chicago, with a total
          seating capacity of more than 20,000 persons. Violations of the build ing ordinances
          received thus the only drastic punishment ever known to come from the city hall. 'JThe
          mayor was moved to issue the order by his dispo sition not to take additional responsi
          bility for further calamities. Until they have provided asbestos or iron curtains for the
          protection of their patrons these theaters will remain closed: Academy of Music, Alhambra,

          to-day as a day of mourning throughout Chicago for the dead in the Iroquois theater fire.
          The procl ima tion follows: 'The mayor annoi nces that the city hall will be closed al day
          Saturday on account of tne calamity at the Iroquois theater. He reaped fully requests all
          business houses to close- a mark of respect foi the dead.</text>

        <text>IROQUOIS WILL OPEN AGAIN. Contract for Refittn the Theater Have Been Let and It Will
          Soon Be Reopened to the Public. Chicago, Feb. 8. A contract has been let for refitting and
          redecorating the Iroquois theater, in which 572 lives were lost on December 30 last, It
          has been uncertain whether the Iroquois would open again as a play house, but the letting
          of the contract for repairs indicates that the theater will be reopened to the public as a
          place of amusement. The cost of repairs will be $22,000, and the management hope to reopen
          the house in the early spring. It is said the name of the theater will be changed to the
          'Northwest.' WAS FOUND FROZEN STIFF. MIcliRcl Wlialcn of AnIiIiiuiI, Wla, Became

          C'olUenm to Comply With New' Bnlldlna; Ordinance! Takes Ont Manx Seats.. Chicago, Feb. 8.
          The action of the city building department In limit ing the seating capacity of the coli
          seum, where the national republican convention will be held, to 8,000, has thrown members
          of the national sub committee and local politicians into a turmoil. The action comes, of
          course, as the result of the Iroquois fire hor ror and the reforms started by Mayor
          Harrison following the disaster. With all public halls and gathering places the seating
          capacity has been reduced This will compel a reduction in the apportionment of tickets of
          admission to the different states from what had been expected. It is proposed to give
          Chicago about 2,000 tickets to each ses sion of the convention. These will be turned over
          to the local committee for distribution. x Conduct r Shot by Rolilieri. Chicago, Feb. 7.

          thrown into the flames-' Indeed, so terrific has been the heat ever since the fire started

          was difficult for the fire men to stand long within fighting dis tance of the flames,
          while early in the afternoon several trucks and engines were hopelessly disabled by
          timbers. At 7 o'clock .the situation was So des perate that Chief Horton decided that the

          pursuance of this plan, a number of buildings on South Charles street between German and
          Lombard were blown ip. Subsequently the splendid structure of J. W. Butts Co., notion
          dealers at Charles and Fayette streets was dynamited, and then the Dally Record building,
          Ross' drug store and otners. But this heroic remedy merely delayed, but did not seriously
          Impede the onward march of the conflagration and for two hours or more the fire de

          Following the rapid destruction of the palatial commercial buildings in the wholesale
          district the cyclone of roaring flames burst into Baltimore street, licking within a few
          minutes' the seven-story Mulllns hotel like an insatiate monster and rapidly rolling with
          irresistible force both eastward and westward, cutting down wholesale and retail houses,
          manufactories, shops, jewelry stores, furniture empo riums and restaurants. At Charles
          street the remorseless tide swept on down Baltimore Btreet, and also turned into Charles
          street.'where It quickly en gulfed the eleven-story Union Trust building, starting
          eastward on Fayette street. By 6 o'clock occupants of the Dally Herald building, at
          Fayette and St. Paul streets, and of the Record building, opposite, were compelled to
          vacate by. the onrushing flames, as were the occupants of the Calvert and Equitable
          structures, two of the most massive office buildings in Baltimore. Down Baltimore street a
          parallel wave of roaring, crackling flames swept, consuming everything in its course,
          speedily reaching the Evening News building, from which the em ployes had to hastily flee,

        <text>SATISFACTION GUSB&NTEEe. BUST WORK Of 1 TELEPIH GIRLS They Sometimes Answer-Twelve
          Thousand Calls a Day. NIBHT BUSINESS IS VERY QUIET IMPORTERS, REVELERS AND THE SICK TAKE
          UP MOST OF THE TIME. One Operator Says She Veuld Rather Have Men Call Her 'Dearie'' Than

          ONOLULU Is not a night j town. The people go early H to bed and when the midnight hour is
          at hand, the town is still with the stillness of. a Kew England vil lage. An occasional
          arc-light, winking among' the palms, is about all there is to let a belated newspaperman
          or a late reveler or a messenger in search of a physician, know that the town is not dead
          oniy sleeping. After 11 o'clock, the pedestrians are few and far between, the streets i
          are deserted to the semi-occasional j liceman and the owl-cab. and the quiet respectable
          portion of the community, except of course the newspapermen, are wrapt in the first sweet
          slumber of the night. Even the hello-girls at the Mutual Telephone Company's office have a
          little resting spell. The mere fact that the hello-girls, after an early hour of the
          evening are replaced by hello-boys and they do the resting, really makes no difference,
          except to the girls who get no chance to do anything in that line. The girls are kept very
          busy during the day. especially on steamer day. From the rising of the sun even unto the

          although sometimes I have no doubt that both, the subscriber and the operator think they
          are being misused. The girls are only worked as a rule for four hours at a stretch. The
          first gang of the 2fi operators comes on at 7 o'clock and remains on dutv until 11. Then a

          Some of the first watch returns in the afternoon. At S o'clock all the regular day force

        <text>THE HELLO GIRL Some Things for Patrons of the Tele phone Exchange to Reflect Upon. Few
          persons understand the work ings of a telephone' exchange and therefore are not in
          position to np- jivviuvv tllC 11 Id?, KIl LU7 111- ILKJ 111 and sympathize with her in her
          work. The following from the Statesville Landmark may give them a clearer understandms: of
          her duties and make them more patient and reason able in dealing with her: Considered
          rightly, the 'hello' girl treads no primrose path. Did you ever stop to think that you are
          not the only one who turns in a call to Central during the day? Bless your life, no! Here
          in Statesville between 8 o'clock in the morning and 6 in the evening an average of about
          3,500 calls are made. That means that during the 8 hours that each of the girls is on duty
          she answers about G calls a minute or one every ten seconds, or, when both are on duty at
          the same time, you can split those figures in two. That's an average, but when everybody
          gets in the notion to use the 'phone at the same time, as often happens, it's worse than
          that much worse. If you were in the 'hello' girl's place then, sitting before the board
          with the receiver clamped to your head, you'd wish you were away and away where there
          aren't any telephones. You Bee, it's like this: When you ring, a little number drops down
          and stays until you are given the connection you want, and it does no sort of good for you
          to keep ringing in fact it causes de lay, for you can't be connected while you are are
          ringing and so the operator goes ahead and answers some other call. She's the 'hello'
          girl. If you are close by and listen when she is answering calls during a rush it sounds
          like this: 'hello heHoelloelloellelloelloello hell Indeed it does. So be patient. If you
          don't get con nection immediately don't allow your self to think that the 'hello' girl is,
          per chance, asleep, or gone on a journey, or that ehe cannot hear. Just consider that she
          is dreadfully busy and is doing her level best. It is more than likely 'steen dozen other
          calls are being turned in at the same time.</text>

        <text>HELLO GIRLS OF GOTHAM NO LONGER ALARM CLOCKS FOR SLEEPY-HEADS A. J. WATERHOUSE
          Occidental Accidental order the other day saying that the 'Hello Girls' must not turn
          themselves into alarm clocks, for New York.' 'But you'll be one Just this once for me,
          won't you, dear?' '.'Yes, I suppose so, but you needn't think you can bam boozle me by
          'dearing' me.' And so G. Algernon Knickerbocker turned in, secure in the thought that he
          would catch the train. But he was rather lonely: in this respect, for a few thousand,
          other sleepy New Yorkers failed to get hold of so amiably dlsr posed a 'Hello Girl,' says
          the New York World. Urftil recently it has been the custom of the telephone company to
          permit its subscribers to* use the central sta tion girls for early morning alarm clocks.
          They would take the number on a slip Indicating the time the sleeper wanted to be called
          and the girl would jingle his bell. But in a short time the company found, that this was
          about the. largest^ part of its business, and decided that it would have to be* stopped.
          The only way. to get round the ukase against making the 'Hello Girl' haul- you back to.
          consciousness in the early morning hour 3 now is to promise her an automobile or a pint of
          diamonds. j Ci j t ELLO, Central! Hello! Hello! Wake lip, can't I—lI I you? I'm in a great
          hurry and I want to leave 1 1 an over-night message with you.' 'Yes. I'm awake and hear
          you. What Is It you want to say?' 'Why, I have to catch an early train out. of town; in
          the morning and- 1 want you to ring, me up not a minute later than ten before 6. Don't be
          a minute late about it, or I shall not have time to catch the train. Wouldn't ask you to
          do this for me, but my family are all out of town and I'm all alone here. 'You won't
          forget me, will you, dear, for I'm a perfect sleepy head, and I know I shall never get
          awake if I'm not called. Just turn on my telephone bell and keep it Jingling till you hear
          from me, that's a good girl, and then I'll not forget you the next time Christmas rolls
          around. Got my phone lashed right alongside of the head of my bed where It's liandy, -and
          if you ring hard I think It will bring me up standing. Will you?' 'Oh, yes. I suppose I
          can call you,' but you mustfnot^say anything about it or I shall get in trouble— flred,
          likely, for it is against the rules of the company. Just got an My mental picture of her
          reminded me of one of .the first minxes I ever met. She thought nothing of being en gaged
          to two or three men at once, and she was forever introducing to her friends some one they
          had never seen before as 'the young man I am at pres ent engaged to.' Her manner of pre
          venting the various young men from clashing was simple but effectual. She would make three

        <text>ALL ABOUT THE HELLO GIRLS LABOR COMMISSIONER NEILL OBSERVES THEM He fays There Is No
          Use for Short Girls; That the Companies Want Girls Who Can Reach Some Require Girls With a
          Calm, Clear Eye and Good Appetite If you have any trouble in getting your telephone calls
          through blamo Labor Commissioner Nelll of the De partment of Commerce and Labor, and
          probably you wont be far out of the way. Every hello girl in the country will be busy
          trying to find out just what the Commissioner has said about her. Only a few of them are
          aware that ho had dissected and analyzed them in a report 200 or 300 pages long for tho
          instruction of the United States Senate, but these few have served notice that they will
          insist on seeing in cold type Just what he has found out about them. Tho commissioner has
          left little for the hello girl to find out about her self. 'Look here, Cora,' exclaimed
          one of the Washington telephone girls who had got hold or an abstract of the re port, 'lie
          says we gotta have a calm, clear eye and a steady gaze. I know I gotta clear eye, dear,
          but am I calm? Go on, am I, really? (Hello, Hello. Been waiting1 five minutes? Well, I
          can't help that; wire's busy). And a good appetite and a healthy, rosy com plexion. What
          you think of that. Cora? Say, honest, I always wonderel how I got the job so easy. But
          look at this passage about the companies handin' us men escorts to take us home nights.
          That must be a government joke; honest, it must be, doncha think so?' Complaints from
          hello girls that thev had to walk up too many flights 4 stairs to their work was chiefly
          respon sible for starting the Commissioner on his investigation. He finds that the
          telephone girls as a whole have no ground for complaint on this score. He nails them right
          down on this proposi tion, giving the exact number that have to climb stairs and the
          actual ef fort that is expended. S3ys the Com missioner: 'Of the seventy-three exchanges
          re ported upon by the agents of the bu reau it was found that thirty-three, which were
          located above the first floor, were not provided with elevators. Of these exchanges
          fifteen were located on the second floor, requiring the climbing of one flight of stairs;
          ten cn the third floor, requiring the climb ing of three flights of stairs. The max imum
          number of operators affected by such lack of elevators, therefore, being required to climb
          one flight of stairs was 00; those required to climb two flights of stairs 108, while 75
          found it necessary to climb three flights or stairs.' The Commissioner finds that there is
          no use of short girls trying to beconio telephone operators. 'None of the companies employ
          short girls; they want girls that can reach,' he said. 'The girl who is un der five feet
          hasn't any show.' The Commissioner finds that very few of the companies take girls with
          out first subjecting- them to a physi cal examination. In some cities the girls object to
          this, but these will be surprised to learn that they were ex amined without knowing it.
          'In one city where the girls inter viewed said that no physical examina tion or test had
          been made,' says the Commissioner, 'it was ascertained that the applicants are interviewed
          by a wo man whose exact height is known, and in talking to the applicants can by comparing
          the level of the eyes with her own tell within a fraction of an inch the height of the
          girl with whom she is talking. Experts in lines interviewed the c7,;:rioants an
          ascertained their exact physical conu' tion.' Some of the companies, besides re quiring of
          their candidates a calm, clear eye, a good appetite and a rosy com plexion, demand that
          they shall have a steady band and a firm set jaw; also that they shall not be easily
          excitable. Of 0152 applicants the Commissioner found that 2229 were unable to qualify, C44
          being too small, .r3 too old, 430 too young, 11 refusing to work on Jewish holidays; 0
          declining to be vaccinated, and 100 being lacking in personal ap pearance. The
          Commissioner figures that the average working life at the switch board is only three
          years. Ho finds that in no other industry in the United States are so great precautions
          taken to insure the health of tho employes. He has discovered that in the good oil summer
          time the hello girls, that is the few of them that are sick, suffer from digestive
          complaints, probably too much ice cream and candy. The girls of many exchanges get their
          luncheons right in the company'.' office. 'Hygienic luncheons,' the com panies call them,
          and they say that these luncheons prevent the afternoon 'dulness -and headaches' that
          raise hob with the service when the 'pealc of the load' is reached. By the way, any
          Senator who reads Mr. Neil's re port will be qualified to talk telephone with the oldest
          hello girl In existence. t 'Peak of the load,' 'side reach,' 'up- reach,' 'jacks' and
          'split trick' are only a few of the expressions that go to make up the telephone girl's
          busi ness vacabulary. The Commissioner finds also that many oT the companies, especially
          the New Yc 1. company, 'Is engaged in a system c' welfare work among its em ployes.' They
          have libraries and par lors where the girls may lounge dur ing the rest hours; also boat
          ride ex cursions, theatre parties and art muse um parties under the supervision of a
          competent teacher. This uplift feature of the report, particularly tho theatre party
          sugges tion, has made a hit with the telephone girls in this city, and the companies that
          haven't got onto this wrinkle yet are sure to be infonned of it. Some of the hello girls
          also may want to know of their employers why they aren't furnished with roof gardens for
          lounging places. The Commission er finds that some companies have such gardens and he
          recommends that more of them be established. The Commis sioner hands out this compliment
          to the girls: 'The loyalty and esprit de corp3 among telephone girls is greater than in
          any other industry in the country.' Mr. Neill takes the part of the tele phone girls
          against a peevish public. He says that the average switchboard girl has a hundred
          telephone cafl sig nals to watch. As each call comes in a light flashes on a signal cap.
          Many signal lights glow simultaneously and there is a clicking sound in the oper ator's

          the monitor cutting in a: any minute and reprimanding her. Under the rules of the

          by them. 'They really enjoy the excitement, and exhilaration,' says the Commis sioner. The
          Commissioner regards 225 calls an hour as the breaking point of effic iency for a girl,
          although she handles sometimes as many as COO calls an hour. The Commissioner has found
          that 92.7 percent of the hello girls are un married or 'conjugal condition un known,' 4
          percent are married and 2.7 percent are widows. New York Sun. Japanese Sensitiveness.
          Sensitiveness exists in the Japan ese to an extent never supposed by the foreigners who
          treat them harshly at the open ports. In Izumo I knew a cuse of a maid servnnt who
          received a slight rebuke with a smile and then quietly went out and hung herself. 1 havo
          notes of many curious suicides of a similar sort. And yet the Japan ese master is never
          brutal or cruel. How Japanese can serve a certain class of foreigners at all I can't

          masKs of Oho-kumi-nushi-no-kaml they sea at Mlon osek. One day I looked through a lit tle
          hole in the shoji and saw him alone. The face was not the same face. It was thin and
          drawn, and showed queer lines worn by old hard ship. I thought 'he will look just like
          that when he is dead.' I went in, and the man was all changed young and happy again nor
          have I ever seen that look of trouble in his face since. But 1 know when he is alone he

          came out in a statement by T. P. ylvan, vice-president in charge of personel, to the
          Public Service Commission, repntly made. New Dormitory for the Girl*. Mr. Sylvan said that
          the need of operators ad been so urgent in the city that 263 exerienced girls had been
          brought ln$o the setropolitan area from up-State and" other callties. The cost of the
          rooms that had to e provided for them was $35,000 a month, low, he stated, a dormitory was
          almost ompleted, whither the hello girls will be ran sf erred. When the girls were first
          brought here to elp out in the service they were to have een housed in a dormitory in one
          of the ig "centrals," but before they arrived this pace had to be used for additional
          service oards, and so the hotel accommodation was rovided. It was only a temporary
          arrangement. In several of the centrals both for Manattan .and long distance there are

          but is capable of being exended." So spoke an assistant of Mr. Sylvan, and ie added a
          description of the rest rooms ,-hieh sounded very attractive. "The rooms are really
          prepared and furilshed so that the girls when off duty can pally relax. The furniture was
          selected by xperts for that purpose, and the divans, ofas and chairs, are of a kind that

          women they would try to get along with a hard afternoon's work before them on a doughnut
          and Ice cream soda. Nobody can do good work on fare like that. So the company established
          the lunch room. There we give wholesome, well cooked foid at exceedingly low prices.
          Expert dieticians plan the meals and they are prepared in modern kitchens. "Here is a

          referred to. It is maintained by the company without cost to the operator. The anniversary

          Recruiting for Wext Year. Vice-President Sylvan is quoted as saying that while the company
          has enough operators to fill all of its switchboard positions at present, it will require
          16 per cent, more next year. It is therefore necessary to recruit and train new operators
          constantly?1,876 new switchboard positions will lie opened by January of next year. The
          automatic switchboard which was re-' eently dpscribed and illustrated in The New York
          HeraldwHI be in use in New York city early next year in the Pennsylvania, Academy and
          Llspenard centres. Its operation will be watched with considerable curiosity and the
          future switchboard is sure to bo of this type. It is a mistake, however, to think th.it
          the change from manual to machine switching Is to come quickly. Ten or twelve years at
          least will bo required for the transition. "What is to become of your accomplished 'hello'
          girls when manual switching becomes old fashioned?" This question brought a quick answer,
          showing that the point had been raised before. Here is the answer: "We need all our
          employees and all will be absorbed in the different lines of duty. Nobody need worry about
          the closing up of Jobs." Transportation During Car Strike. It is a record of pride with
          the telephone company, the accomplishment during the transportation tie-up in Brooklyn
          early in this year. Ten thousand persons were transported every day the strike lasted.
          This included 5,000 to and from New York. Eighiynine cars were used in the automobile
          fleet and 315 men were required to work these cars. Forty company cars were used and
          fortynine out of town buses. The average speed of each bus, including waiting time, was
          eleven miles an hour, and that of the company cars beat this time by an hour. In spite of
          the adverse conditions, a re?ular bus schedule w:ts maintained. Everything1 was sacrificed
          to the successful operation of the hastily built up transportation system The men of the
          company worked hours overtime and spent every energy in making things go as comfortably
          and quickly as possible, because they were doing it as a service to the hello girls. It is
          computed that during the strike there .was an increase in telephone calls In the
          twenty-six exchanges in Brooklyn of 2fi per cent. In the Wall street disaster the girls at
          the switchboards that serve the great financial district proved themselves true soldiers
          and worked hours on end to bring help and relief to the victims of the explosion. It
          occurred Just before the girls were to go to lunch. Fortunately they had not yet left the
          board, and In the ensuing excitement lunch was forgotten. It wns said of the operators
          efficient cooperation to distracted callers on the wires that the latter, by force of
          example, became cooler. These hello girls, Indeed, nre said to have k' pt their heads
          better than operators at switchboards much further away from tho scene of the disaster. On
          that afternoon 76,761 calls were put through the Beekman and Hanover central office and
          the annex. This was about 26,000 more than usual. The operators said thai they were able
          to do this work because the subscribers seemed to understand the difficult situation they
          were In and to cooperate wherever possible. A total Increase over the average day In this
          busy region was 40 petcent. Unmoved by Curlo?lty. And the surprising trait the hello girls
          showed on this trying occasion was their own restraint of curiosity. As the calls came
          pouring in with cries from the subscribers of "What's the matter?" the girl." who refused
          to leave the board would reply: "We don't know, except that It Is something terrible." i

          ALL ABOUT THE HELLO GIRLS LA DO R COMMISSIONER NEILL OBSERVES THEM
          rays There is No Use for Short Girls; That the Companies Want üiris Who Can Reach—Some
          Require Girls With a Calm, Clear Eye and Good Appetite j If you have any trouble in
          getting our telephone calls through blame .aber Commissioner Neill of the De aitment of
          Commerce and Labor, and iobaLly you wont be far out of the ay. Every hello girl in the
          country j ill be busy trying to find out just what Commissioner has said about her. y a
          few of them are aware that he had disserted and analyzed them in a report 20o or 300 pages
          long for the instruction of the United States Senate, ut these few have served notice that
          they will insist on seeing in cold type just what he has found out about them. The
          commissioner has left little for the hello girl to find out about her self. "Look here,
          Cora," exclaimed one of the Washington telephone girls who had got hold of an abstract of
          the re po 1 "He says we gotta have a calm, clear eye and a steady gaze. I know I gotta
          clear eye, dear, but am I calm? Go on, am I, really? (Hello, Hello. Been waiting five
          minutes? Well, l can't help that; wire's busy). And a good appetite and a healthy, rosy
          com plexion. What you think of that. Cora? Say, honest, I always wondere 1 how I got the
          job so easy. But look at this passage about the companies handin' us men escorts to take
          us home nights. That must be a government joke; honest, it must be, doncha think so?"
          Complaints from hello girls that they had to walk up too many flights of stairs to their
          work was chiefly respon sible for starting the Commissioner on his investigation. He finds
          that the telephone girls as a whole have no ground for complaint on this score. He nails
          them right down on this proposi tion, giving the exact number that have to climb stairs
          and the actual ef fort that is expended. Says the Com missioner: Of the seventy-three
          exchanges re ported upon by the agents of the bu reau it was found that thirty-three,
          which were located above the first floor, were not provided with elevators. Of these
          exchanges fifteen were loearej on the second floor, requiring the climbing of one flight
          of stairs; ten on the third floor, requiring tne climb ing of three flights of stairs. The
          max imum number of operators affected by such lack of elevators, therefore, being required
          to climb one flight of stairs was 60; those required to climb two flights of stairs 108,
          while 75 found it necessary to climb three flights or etairs." j j j

          j I I j I The Commissioner finds that there is no use of short girls trying to become
          telephone operators. "None of the companies employ short girls; they want girls that can
          reach," he said. "The girl \\ho is un der five feet hasn't any show." The Commissioner
          finds that very few of the companies take girls with out first, subjecting them to a physi
          cal examination. In some cities the girls object to this, but these will be surprised to
          learn that they were ex amined without knowing it. "In one city where the girls inter
          viewed said that no physical examina tion or test had been made," says the Commissioner,
          "it was ascertained that the applicants are interviewed by a wo man whose exact height is
          known, and in talking to the applicants can by comparing the level of the pyes with her
          own tell within a fraction of an Inch the height of the girl with whom she Is talking.
          Experts in ..r-r lines interviewed the .i:.- -:icant 3 avi ascertained their exact
          physical ronu> tion." Some of the companie quiring of their candidates eye, a good appente

          i States are so great precaution^ taken. tp insure the health of th in pc, mal ap
          employes. He has discovered that in the good oil j Bummer time the hello girls, that is
          the few of them that are sick, from digestive complaints, probably too much Ice cream and
          candy. The girls of many exchanges get their luncheons right in the omcanv' office.
          "Hygienic luncheons," the com panies call them, and they say that these luncheons prevent
          the uffer j fternoon 'dulness and headaches tint raise hob with the service when the "peak
          of the load" Is reached. Ey the wav any Senator who reads Mr. Neil's re port will be
          qualified to talk telephone with the oldest hello girl in existence.

          1 i "Peak of the load," "side reach," "up reach," "jacks" and "split trick" are only a few
          of the expressions that go to make up the telephone girl's bus; ness vacabulary. j
          Commissioner finds also that man y 0 f the companies, especially the New York company. "Is
          engaged in a system of welfare work among its em ployes." They have libraries and par lors
          where the girls may lounge dur ing the rest hours; also boat ride ex cursions, theatre
          parties and art muse um parties under the supervision of a competent teacher. This uplift
          feature of the report, particularly the theatre party sugges tion, has made a hit with the
          telephone girls in this city, and the companies that haven't got onto this wrinkle yet are
          sure to be informed of it. Some of the hello girls also may want to know of their
          employers why they aren't furnished with roof gardens for lounging places. The Commission
          er finds that some companies have such gardens and he recommends that more of them be
          established. The Commis sioner hands out this compliment to the girls: "The loyalty and
          esprit de corps among telephone girls is greater .than i-n any other industry in the
          country."

          Mr. Neill takes the part of the tele- phone girls against a peevish public 1 M 0 ___ _____
          says that the ateiage switchboard girl has a hundred telephone cafl sig- 1 nais to watch.
          As each call comes in n liost or I 3 fa nal t' a P- "any signal lights glow simultaneously
          and there is a clicking sound in the oper ator's ear every time the receiver is moved up
          and down. With all this confusion in front of her the hello giil has to contend too with a
          supervisor who stands behind her and calls out the numbers to ofher operators when she
          falls behind in her work. She is in fear also of the monitor cutting in at any minute and
          reprimanding her. Under the rules of the companies she is allowed to say only "Number,
          please," no matter how much she is abused. When the peevish party be gins to scold and
          asks why in thunder ation he hasn't got his number, he is delaying her with the other
          calls that are coming in, and is not only lessen in S his own chance of getting quick
          service, but is delaying other people and making it hard for the switch hoard girl.

          I j The Commissioner adds that if the people who put off their morning tele phoning until
          11.30 and their afternoon telephoning until 5 would only remem ber that these are the
          heaviest hours of the day, the "peaks of the load," they would get better service and make
          j 'ife easier for the girls. I Some of the hello girls may be sur prised to know "that
          spasms of rush" that last for only a few minutes are regarded as fun by them. They really
          enjoy the excitement and exhilaration," says the Commis sioner. The Commissioner regards
          225 calls an hour as the breaking point of effic iency for a girl, although she handles
          sometimes as many as 600 calls an hour. The Commissioner has found that 92.7 percent of
          the hello girls are un married or "conjugal condition un known," 4 percent are married and
          2.7 percent are widows.—New York Sun. Japanese Sensitiveness. Sensitiveness exists in the

          Water valley hello GIRLS GO ON STRIKE Jackson, Miss., May 7.—The first strike of hello
          girls on record in Mis sissippi is reported fi'om Water Val ley, where five young ladles
          employed on the switchboard of the Cumberland exchange, quit work because of a dis#
          agreement with the local manager, V. L. Lawehe, and appealed their case to the general
          manager's office at Nash ville. An inspector was sent to Water Val ley to investigate the
          trouble, and sus tained the manager, time a new crew of hello girls had been mustered into
          service and the striking girls are now Jobless, as is also a lineman, who struck all by
          him self out. of sympathy^ with the young ladies.

          All Praise to tlie ''Hello Girls" j The telegraphers' strike in all parts of the United
          States has caused a great deal of inconvenience to the newspapers, but the pretty "Hello
          Girls" of the various telephone companies have met the situation in a way and manner that
          is deserving more than passing notice. There are no set of people that deserve more praise
          than these same "Hello Girls," and in many instances they receive nothing but abuse. We
          would like to see the papers of the country, in all fairness, give these hard-worked girls
          the credit due them; for to them a great portion of the news items that appear in our
          great dailies, are due. All praise to the ''Hello Girl!"

          Our Personalities Play Important Part In Telephone Girl’s Mistakes. One of the big
          telephone companies' Is conducting a thorough series of scienti fic tests to find out why
          the “hello gills" sometimes give us the wrong number, why they cut us off In the middle of
          a most Important sentence, w hy tiny sometimes answer sharply when we make a modest
          prote.-t. and. in short, to find out what every telephone user would like to know. The
          tests are being conducted princi pally at Cambridge, Mass. Observations are being made
          upon 75,000 telephone girls in many parts of the country. ITof. j Hugo Huenstei berg, the
          well-known pro- I fessor of psychology at Harvard Reiver- sity, lias been called In to
          assist in mak-’ lng ttie tests, but be is only one of the! many experts engaged In the
          work. One of the psychological experiments j tried by Prof. Muensterberg was as fol- lows:
          He gut It ed all tin r.ew girls in the Cambridge central together and gave each of them a
          copy of the same news paper, with the same three columns marked in each. Every girl was
          re- j quired to go over »he columns in order' and cross out all the letter “a's.’’ tfome
          of the girls crossed out 90 per cent, of the letters in the first column. 75 per cent, in
          the second column and 30 per cent, in the third. That showed a i defective power of
          attention and con centration. Other girls got only 20 per cent, right in the first column,
          but im proved as they went on, reaching in some cases 98 per cent, correct in the last
          column. This indicated an aptitude for application. Hypnotizing ny rnone. Prof.
          Mi’ensti-rberg 'performed several otlier psychological experiments. At the end of six
          months the results obtained by him will hi' compared with the ordi nary reports of the
          telephone managers concerning the new girls on probation. If the psychological testa and
          the ordi nary reports agree substantially In their conclusions it will appear that the pro
          fessor has found a simple way of select ing efficient '•hello girls.'’ Prof. Muensterberg
          is a great believer In the psychological value and uses of the telephone. “I have even
          hypnotised over the tele phone." he says. It appeals that when a person has re sisted
          hypnotism applied by the o;x ratnr diivctb i1 may he possible to hypontize him by a
          suggestion conveyed over the telephone in a manner to take the sub ject oft his guard. If
          Prof. Muensterberg .could hypnotize persons over the tele phone, how much more effectively
          could a “hello girl" with a nice voice do it. Contrary to the older theory of animal
          magnetism, personal contact is entirely unnecessary for hypnotism, and the mere
          suggestion, conveyed by writing or by telephone is sufficient to induce hyp nosis. Prof.
          Pierre 5anet, of the Univer sity of Paris, hypnotized Mine. R. by telephone, and induced
          her in a hypnotic trance to leave her house, in a distant part of the city of Havre, and
          go to the house of Dr. (Jibert. Out of a series of -5 experiments 19 were successful. Now,
          these experiments have a most important relation to those carried out upon the "hello
          girls" at Cambridge. One of the most interesting facts brought out by the Cambridge
          experiments was that Cupid was the most serious factor in upsetting the mental processes
          of the girls. Not only was their attention dis tracted by sentimental affairs already in
          their minds, but the voices of strange pien having a certain emotional affinity for them
          heard over the telephone for the first time, exercised an extremely perturbing influence
          upon them. The average telephone girl only stays In the service three years, matrimony,
          being the cause of her leaving in 90 per cent, of cases. During all this period the girl
          lias her mind more or less on the possible man of her choice and to that extent her
          attention may lie distracted from the calls of the public. There are, of course, many
          girls who can have an engagement and yet answer calls effi ciently. The Gifted Phone Girl.
          When a man gets married it usually Intensifies Ids interest in his work, hut with a woman
          even the prospect of this event commonly ends all thoughts of work. Fur many reasons the
          “hello girls” an' especially desirable as wives and this helps to derange the service
          Before starting work they must pass an examination, showing that they pos sess good
          health, intelligence, and gen eral capacity. They are usually gifted physically, as they
          are required to he ambidextrous. Fur instance, they un called upon to use both hands with
          equal facility ill handling ilte plugs of tile switchboard. This training fits them to
          hold a baby and handle a carpets weeper at one and the i t me time. Very frequently a man
          becomes inter ested in a girl simplj through hearing her voice over the telephone ICxperi
          ments have shown clearly tliuL there is something peculiarly fascinating to a man in a
          nice girl's void- heard over the telephone. He hears the voice, but does not see the girl,
          and imagination conn s Into play. If a girl Is good natured. a mail can tell it as a rule
          by the inflection of her voice over the ’phone and also h> the character of her reply to a
          r> nark. 'Thus the telephone compan:. is robbed of its most agreeable employes by Cupid.
          As Hie girl can exercise so much influ ence upon men by her voice over the 'phone, it
          follows that the men possess u similar power. The truth ot this was established by
          experiment. Men's Voices Affect bervice. A vigorous young man of 39, or quick mind,
          agreeable manners, and strong vi tality, was instructed to cull up the ex change and ask a
          question requiring more than the usual amount of attention. The girls were, of course,
          ignorant that any such experiment was being made. scientific observer was present In the
          exchange to note the result of the experi ment. “Please call S200 Chelsea and give a good,
          long ring, because the party 1* likelb to be upstairs,’’ said tile youpg man. “W-, sir,"
          said the operator, with a biight-eyed, cheerful expression. An elderly man. with a
          querulous voice and a feeble constitution, was then in structed to All up the exchange and
          ask certam questions. •‘Give me -J01 Brookline and tell them to put Mrs. Jones on the
          ’phone. Don’t want to speak to anybody else," said tbe old man. “\Ye don’t deliver
          messages," replied the operator, with a distinct note of v. earlf.vss in her voice, as she
          cut oft the inquirer.
